0,RUE030N50F9EJ,B09PYVXXW5,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good with a couple of flaws,CTM,5.0,"I love TWS earbuds. I have many including buds from Sony, Samsung, AKG, Amazon, Soundpeats and more. I was intrigued by small size of the 1More Minis and wanted to try them. For the most part, they are wonderful. They are literally half the size of my other buds with most of the same features. Remarkable. I don't really like large buds hanging out of my ears and really loathe the stemmed variety like Airpods. These minis almost disappear and their extremely light weight makes them very comfortable. The sound is really good, they have very decent ANC and transparency modes, they have in ear detection and an app for some customization. I have no idea how they can manage to squeeze all of these features into such a small bud. On top of the features, the buds last 5 hours with ANC and 6 hours without. Amazing. I would unconditionally recommend these buds except for two annoyances that EVERY YouTube reviewer has complained about. First, limited customization of tap controls. These don't have single tap capability. I understand that to some degree because the buds are so small that it would probably be impossible to reposition them without stopping or starting your music. The bigger problem is 1More's use of Sound ID rather than ""real"" equalizer controls. Sound ID works by offering A/B samples that you select and it creates a profile based on your selections. It's horrible and doesn't work at all for me. I tried it at least 10 times and the Sound ID profile was always worse than the out of the box sound. I have been forced to use third part equalizers on my phone to get them to sound the way I want. 1More, if you want to keep your Sound ID, please add some presets and a manual equalizer the way many others do like Soundcore for example. I dislike Sound ID so much that it prevented me from buying their new EVO buds. I had the buds in my cart and then cancelled the order. The EVO cost more than the mini and I simply didn't want to deal with Sound ID again. If 1More adds equalization and perhaps allows for more tap options, these buds would be fantastic. As it is, I really like them and will workaround the app shortcomings. 1More, if you are listening, I know you can fix these problems. You can make a great product even greater!","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2022",AEGYSY5H3ZUJC4SGGPRM3Z2OE5PA,1,32,Color: Black,410,1.0
1,R385JSD6KWP2QU,B09PYVXXW5,"4.0 out of 5 stars I wish I could rate 5 stars, but…",Gianna,4.0,"…I just can’t. Because as useful as these earbuds are, there’s one huge caveat to them that needs to be made clear.Let’s start with the positive: the ComfoBuds Mini are incredible for sleeping. While they’re not advertised as sleep buds, I find it hard to believe that they weren’t designed with sleep in mind. The flat shape, the small size, the selection of noise-blocking ambient sounds included in the app, even a sleep timer…while you certainly CAN use them as everyday buds (and if you have very small ears, you might want to) these are clearly intended for being comfortable enough to wear at night and block out unwanted noises. I love them for that. I previously hated wearing noise-cancelling earbuds at night, which was somewhat of a necessity to me due to my wife’s snoring problem; with these buds, I ditched the discomfort and pain and accidental button triggering in favor of a much more comfortable experience, to the point where I actually enjoyed putting them in every night. They’re not called the “ComfoBuds” for nothing.The ANC is not the best I’ve ever tried, but gets the job done as far as helping to seal out those pesky nighttime disruptions. Sound quality is admittedly not the greatest. Don’t get me wrong, it’s perfectly acceptable, it just suffers in a few areas that probably directly relate to the size of the buds. Soundstage is poor, instrument separation is very poor, and the volume tends to skew on the quiet side, but if you’re using these for sleep, none of that matters too much.Now here comes the real caveat.1MORE is clearly having a serious quality control issue with the ComfoBuds mini. I can’t say for certain whether this extends to their other models, as this is the only product of theirs I’ve tried. And while the idea is fantastic and they’ve clearly put a lot of effort into the design of these buds, there’s a persistent issue with one or both earbuds suddenly losing its noise-cancelling ability after a very short period of time, producing whooshing or roaring noises instead of blocking sound.“It’s just earwax blocking up the buds!” insist the apologist reviewers, as well as 1MORE themselves. “Clean them and they’ll be fine!” But I beg to differ. With my first pair of these, the whooshing started in the right earbud after about two months of use. I immediately followed every bit of advice I could find about cleaning them, to no avail. I thought, okay, that’s a bummer, and I sent them back and ordered another pair. The left earbud of the second pair started whooshing within two weeks. I repeat: TWO WEEKS. I had used them less than ten times since I got them, plus I was being very careful about cleaning my ears every day, so there is NO WAY that they accumulated enough earwax during that time to block them up. Something else is going on. I wonder if trying to cram so much tech into such a small package is backfiring, and the components are interfering with each other somehow. Maybe that’s why you don’t normally see ANC in buds of this size.1MORE will replace malfunctioning buds for you, but the process does take a while, and you’ll be without them in the meantime. It seems they’re aware of the issue, which is good. I really hope that they’ll figure out what’s wrong and release a second version of the ComfoBuds Mini that doesn’t have these problems.I should probably take off more than one star for the quality control issue…but I just can’t bring myself to. Because when these buds are working, they’re really the perfect sleep buds, and I just can’t see myself ditching them; nothing blocks out my wife’s snoring more comfortably than these. I only hope that they’ll continue to improve in the future. In the meantime, it’s up to you to decide if the risks outweigh the benefits.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2023",AHINA7A6O2I5RZSNAY4OWYN4QXVA,1,31,Color: Red,657,0.75
2,R1UB1V4EPP9MN3,B09PYVXXW5,"5.0 out of 5 stars Basically perfect, fantastic wind ANC, perfect case",Colin M.,5.0,"I needed a replacement for my Galaxy buds pro's that have the fatal ANC ""roar in one ear"" that Samsung won't fix, and they don't stay in the ear. Bring an absolutely ENORMOUS fan of the 1more comfobuds z (the single best sleep focused earbuds at any price) I liked that these are also small, the case shape is wonderful (flip top, tiny, wireless charger) and they're relatively inexpensive.The sound quality uses 1more's app to do a ""sounds"" hearing preference test. I would prefer a proper EQ option but it works well enough. I prefer real audiophile iem's and headphones, but enjoyed the Galaxy buds on bass boost, they almost hit like planar magnetics. These are about 80% there. They're totally serviceable, with the only standout being a pretty good technical performance, with genuinely solid imaging and separation. They absolutely do need the soundID set up though, I hate the stock tuning. For tiny little things they are, I am perfectly happy with the sound quality when I want music on my bike or public transit.The ANC is stellar. They have a specific mode for wind reduction that downright curbstomps Samsung and apple. If you ride a bike, you need 1more ANC buds. The transparency mode is great too, very natural sounding. It doesn't have that ""talk and it switches to transparency"" gimmick, but I found it obnoxious on Samsung.Touch controls are easily customized and no ""single touch"" feature means you don't accidentally press anything readjusting or putting them in. Auto pauses when you take one out, your can use just one or the other no problemThe app features depend on the product but these are meant to be usable for sleeping, do they come preloaded with a library of sleep/ambient sounds. I just use my own but it's a nice feature. I can easily fall asleep with them in and I'm a very picky side sleeper, but I do prefer the absolutely microscopic comfobuds z's.The stock eartips did bother me a bit, they have a little ridge from the mold that irritated my ears after a few hours of use. They have a very odd mounting system that I was only able to find one option for, spinfit 1025 tips are shallow enough to fit and still let the case close (the wells for the eartips is a bit to shallow, id like it if they addressed this on a revision) so if you don't like the tips, spinfit 1025's.The case magnets that hold the buds in are hilariously strong. Your have to SMACK it to dislodge them. Very nice detail. The case size is tiny and perfectly shaped to slide into pockets, with a flip top that you can open one handedFor being so small they also stay put well. Not perfect, but I can work out or mow the lawn, an impossible task of the Galaxy buds pro.Overall though, these things rock. They're exactly what I need as a paramedic who also rides a bicycle. 1more is a serious brand with some seriously well thought out products at extremely competitive prices. I can sleep on my side with a podcast and still be able to wake up for a call, they crush wind nose when I'm riding my bike, they sound perfectly adequately tuned with impressive imaging (once you run the sound id feature once) and the case is (slightly too shallow recessions for the eartips aside) very nice in the hand and perfectly shaped.Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2022",AFG2T5XGMQCACK7JBDRHKEKWJLPA,1,21,Color: Red,579,1.0
3,RWYK1GXIVV6H1,B09PYVXXW5,1.0 out of 5 stars Decent but Defective,Aquila,1.0,"UPDATE 6/24/22: As of 6/23/22, my replacement earbuds have the same problem. Sound is reduced then completely lost in the right earbud just a couple of weeks after normal use. Down to 1 star instead of 3 stars. Returning them. Stay within high quality brands like Sony, Bose, and Sennheiser. Replacing them with Sony WFC 500’s.UPDATE 6/5/22: Amazon replaced my earbuds after some arm twisting. My updated review is underneath the original:After my cheap but mighty pair of Sony wired earphones finally died after years of use, I decided to do some research and finally try earbuds after years of scoffing at the wireless craze. I decided on these due to having small ears. My first pair of comfobuds mini were defective. The right earbud made a ringing noise as soon as I began to use them out of the box. 2 weeks after purchase, the right earbud had no sound. Max sound volume doesn’t sound very loud unless you have ANC mode turned on. It does not have a proper equalizer. With my defective pair, ANC mode drowned out the melodies even though the bass was good, so the sound wasn’t very balanced. The touch controls hardly work nor are they very customizable. You sacrifice some features that should be included in this price point for the small size.Review for replacement earbuds:The packaging was different. These came in a black box with a manufacture date of 4/2022. My defective pair was in a white box with a 2/2022 manufacture date. Both pairs of the earbuds were black. The touch controls are more responsive and they work 70% of the time instead of the 20% success rate of my defective pair, but the controls are still very limited for the price point. These definitely are as loud as they should be at max volume. Bass is good and the sound is more balanced. The bass in the defective pair was definitely stronger, but it overpowered and drowned out the melodies, making the sound unbalanced and less dynamic. I’m not sure if this has to do with the pair itself or the firmware. I have been on firmware version 0.10.38 for both pairs and have not yet updated, so it may be the pair itself. Eartips are comfortable but they may be problematic as they don’t create enough of a buffer between your ear and the mesh, so your mesh may get waxy which may impact the sound. Keep them and your ears clean and I recommend buying better aftermarket eartips. Since this is my first pair of wireless earbuds ever, I really can’t accurately measure how good the ANC is as I have nothing to compare it to yet. I ride trains frequently and I never hear my surroundings when ANC is turned on. The battery life seems low at a 4 hour play time with ANC enabled, but the charging case replenishes life fairly quickly. 1more customer service was fine and replied to me quickly, but I ended up getting the replacement faster through Amazon customer service. Overall I’ll bump the earbuds up to a 3 out of 5 stars. They lose points for the lack of touch controls, lack of a real equalizer, and being overpriced. The sound is decent, the size is great, and they are light-weight and comfortable. While I still prefer the sound quality of wired earphones, I’ll keep these in my collection if they don’t fizzle out on me too fast again.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2022",AGFUWY2GO4HF5RMLUR7ZOSKID4KA,1,9,Color: Black,578,0.0
4,R3FBQBGQM3II4W,B09PYVXXW5,3.0 out of 5 stars I went with soundcore instead,Frankie,3.0,"So out of the box these tiny buds surprised me. The fit was amazing for me considering I’m one of those with extremely tiny ears. The sound was okay but after setting up soundid they sounded pretty good with nice bass and clarity. Now on to the bad.ANC.. was alright then I started noticing the left bud wouldn’t function like the right one. A day later whenever anc was enabled the left bud would vibrate and distort sound. Tried resetting and all of that but it’s clearly a hardware issue as it now happens whenever I try to use them. These buds also lack a mono sound when only one is in use. I own many buds and I’ve never run into that before so when using one bud you’re missing out on a lot of tucked away frequencies. When anc was functioning properly it was eh at best. To me more sound was canceled out with all functions turned off. I’ve literally only had these for 3 days and they’re defective already which is a shame because I like the sound and how they fit. Transparency mode was a little much for me especially considering you can’t adjust the volume for it.Touch controls are hardly customizable, I’m not a fan of only having two tap and triple tap functions.Call quality was actually pretty bad. The person I was talking to would constantly drop out and sound like staticEDIT:Now both earbuds produce a loud buzzing sound whenever using anc/transparency mode. You can hear and feel it, the buds will actually vibrate a bit. They work fine with anc/transparency mode turned off. Would really like a replacement.","Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2022",AEOFU2SCDWYLS6DTSXIR6FWMRQMQ,1,7,Color: Black,276,0.5

Also, even if they stay connected, these earbuds will stop playing audio when switching from one app to another.

If you use Spotify, you can get it to sound the same or better than AirPods 2 with the EQ.On the negative side, the ear tips are really poor. They burn my ears after I have removed them and readjusted a couple of times throughout the day.I had ordered both black and white, and the black case came defective, it wouldn’t charge wirelessly, and had a physical defect on the left side.Other than that, after wearing them a couple of hours they seem a bit uncomfortable if not put on properly. It all goes back to the eartips, as I feel I can’t wear them properly if my ears are burning.Be careful around children as these are tiny.

8,RKZ7RXOAQCUT9,B09PYVXXW5,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, comfortable headphones",Victoria,4.0,"I'm very impressed with these little earbuds. I bought them because I have noisy upstairs neighbors and needed some noise cancelling headphones to help me sleep. I'm a side sleeper, and while these aren't totally perfect for that, they're comfortable enough that I don't have trouble falling asleep. It helps if you use a very squishy pillow (my memory foam pillow is too firm and makes them dig into my ears). They're very comfortable for regular daily use too. I have an oddly shaped ear canal that makes earbuds constantly fall out of my left ear, but these are small enough that they fit snugly.I'm no audiophile, but the sound is good. Can't complain. They don't sound as good as my Bose headphones that I normally wear, but they're like 1/50 of the size so I can't really fault them for that. I wish the app let you adjust the sound settings manually. As far as I can tell, you can only adjust them by taking their sound preference quiz. The touch controls are a little annoying. The tutorial said you double tap to play/pause, but I've never gotten that to work. They do sometimes randomly pause when I remove or adjust them, though.The noise cancelling works really well. I was kind of blown away by it, since I've never had earbuds with ANC capabilities before. I can't hear the thumping from my neighbors' music at ALL. Way better than I was expecting. It also blocks out the sound of my fan completely. I can definitely still hear sudden, abrupt noises, but it's very muffled. The ""transparent"" setting is also nice, since I like to be able to hear my surroundings when I'm out walking.These aren't marketed as sleep headphones, and I suspect that is partly because of the battery life. They last around 4 hours with ANC enabled, so they won't last you a full night's sleep. Not a huge deal for me since my neighbors usually cool it with the music at around 4am, but it wouldn't be ideal if you were trying to block out a snoring partner, loud AC unit, etc. For the price I didn't really expect much more than that, but it's significantly less than all of the other wireless earbuds I've owned. They do charge quickly, at least.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AFBVU4557EOTGE76S5GLAV5LAAZQ,1,0,Color: Black,385,0.75
9,R3LR4EEY40BMUY,B09PYVXXW5,4.0 out of 5 stars Finally,TJ Lewis,4.0,"First this is coming someone who's worked in the tech industry for almost 30 years. I own my own IT/technology company and I am truly passionate about technology. Simply put these are the best fitting perfect size earbuds on the market. There are no competitors who make earbuds that aren't giant or hang out of medium to small ears. By combining all metrics that earbuds are judged by today the Comfo Buds minis are in a league of their own. The sound quality iis good, noise canceling decent and has the basic features (transparency, basic touch controls) that we have come expect. With that said it's impossible to provide a negative review of these earbuds without attempting to nitpick, are doing a deep comparison in the technical specifics that ultimately most users don't understand. There are very few things in the technology space that are the best at every facet of their market. If you are someone who has smaller ears or just thinks the average size of earbuds is ridiculous than these earbuds are perfect. No they're not top sound quality top noise canceling, top battery life. They are good everywhere. Let's hope 1More is the company that finally drives true innovation in the earbuds market regarding fit and size. Based on price feature set, fit and sound quality the Comfo buds mini have made all my other buds obsolete. My Samsung buds pro, My sound core Liberty pro 3s no longer have a place in my day. I just ordered the Galaxy s23 ultra and in the deal was included a set of Samsung Galaxy buds pro 2. I will update this review once I get my hands on them.My guess is they will be much larger and not have such overwhelming sound quality, ANC and battery life to overtake the 1More Comfo Buds minis. I finally having a full featured small set of earbuds that Make them very convenient for day-to-day use. Let's not forget you can get two or three pairs of these for the price of the ""high end"" brands. If you are a person with common sense you will love these buds. Let's be honest the majority of negative reviews come from people who see themselves as experts , love to talk detailed acronyms and technical statistics or those who don't quite understand how to use the product. FACT earbud size and fit is the number one failure across the earbud market. IMO 1More realized this simple obvious fact and provided a great product at a great price.

11,R9COQUGRFW18X,B09PYVXXW5,4.0 out of 5 stars Common issues people experiene are easily fixed and avoidable,Evan Reeves-Fortney,4.0,"These are really great earbuds, especially for their size.There are common issues that people run into, which have them replacing the buds using the warranty over and over again before giving up and saying the earbuds seem to suffer from poor quality control or cheap components which fail after a few weeks or months.These issues are a high pitch squeaking noise, and very low volume or no sound. These issues can occur in one side only, or both sides.All you have to do is clean the metal mesh, it's become clogged with your earwax. Trust me, I guarantee that is what the problem is. You have to unclog all the little holes, I used a bristle from a brush which was thin enough to fit. The holes are very tiny.You might start to have volume issues with an earbud not being as loud as the other. It's the holes getting clogged. Once they're all clogged up, you won't be able to hear anything except a very quiet, constant, white noise.The screeching noise occurs when trying to use active noise canceling, while the metal screen is clogged. Don't ask me why, I'm not an expert, but for some reason that's what happens when the mesh is plugged up and you switch to ANC mode. The problem will be completely fixed once you clear out all those tiny holes.Tons of people report these issues occurring after about a month of use, and exchanging them only to run into similar issues with the new pair. It's not the earbuds, it's you. You've got gunk in your ears. You can prevent running into these problems by making sure your ears are clean before using them, cleaning off any earwax after you take them out and before putting them back in the case, and making sure the part of the case where the buds go is clean as well.

I had to return the earbuds. I hope they improve enough in the future that I can invest in them again without these issues.Bluetooth 5.2: Great connection and distance, but in order to connect to different devices you have to go into the device your connected to and disconnect before the other device can connect. My older Bluetooth headphones can release the connection when the new device wants to connect without having to go into the settings like that. (Why no multipoint if they have 5.2?)Also, one bud would randomly disconnect and reconnect occasionally.Call quality is definitely not great, while people said the could hear me fine, the also would say ""what?"" pretty frequently and on my end they sounded so shrill and tinny it was super unpleasant.Noise cancellation was actually really good to me, and the transparency mode was so good it almost felt like I didn't have anything in my ears at all.For dinner reason you can't use transparency mode when only one bud is in. It has to be both buds or not at all.The app crashed frequently. I wish they would allow for more touch control customization. I understand why they chose not to have single tap on these buds but the option would have been nice.Sound quality was awesome for my music, but it didn't carry over to videos and podcasts very well, so having multiple sound profiles would have been nice.The tips suck, not comfortable at all.

While not an expensive earbud option I did expect more for the money. As far as the good I would say they aesthetically nice looking and are very compact. I guess they are as “discreet” as they can be while not being a skin colored piece of plastic in your ear. Sound quality is fine and battery life is decent. Okay, now for the bad. Unlike basically any other earbud, putting the earbuds in the case and closing it does not seem to be an “off switch.” The vast majority of the time they would reconnect while not in use and drain the battery/not charge. Occasionally they would connect to my phone while driving and then I would have to disconnect them and reconnect my phone to car to continue to use my phone to stream to my car audio. They would often just stop while in use with my phone if I got a phone call. I would have to disconnect put in case then take from case to reconnect. Occasionally the listening mode would change on its own from ANC to standard. Overall just bad software/hardware. I only used these for two months and some change and have already replaced them with a superior option for less cash.

The noise cancellation function is nice but not perfect; it's enough for most use cases but if you want complete and total silence, I might look elsewhere.The app is easy to use and convenient, the tap response is very smooth and useful, and the connection is very strong. I'm getting about 5 hours of use per charge, which is nothing to scoff at. The charging case is fairly small. I'm getting a Qi charging pad today so I'll update this review to let you all know whether it's compatible or not.My only complaint is a minor one: the silicon tips that come with these are trash. The driver and tip came apart almost immediately, and for the life of me I can't get them to fit comfortably or stay together. I got some new foam tips which are far better, but the case needs the earbuds to fit very snugly so they won't charge with other tips on. This isn't a deal breaker for me because the pros far outweigh the cons, but it's important enough to document here.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2023",AHSHV43OVBBVOEH7ZAOAC5RGXTAA,1,5,Color: Black,196,0.75

It has impressive sound from such a small package, can get loud enough to drown out background noise with anc on.The two things that prevent this from being perfect are:One, there is no touch controls that I have found to allow you to control the volume. This is a big deal as I use ear buds to listen to tv at night and I'm unable to use these as the volume is always maxed out with no way to lower..Two, you have to use the case to pair to different devices. This makes it difficult to swap connections, I typically switch between a computer, phone, and tv throughout my normal day. With other earbuds I'm able to put them into pairing mode and easily connect to whatever device I'm using without taking them out or using the case.If they could fix these two issues, these would be the only buds I would use, but I do have to switch to one ov my other sets for tv watching do to the volume control.","Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2023",AGWODMFAPF4W6NOBG6LMLCW2XCAA,1,5,Color: Black,186,0.75

I can wear a bandana over my ears and no one can't tell I have earbuds as they don't stick out at all. Others claim they're small but they still stick out. I would say everything else is poor and my biggest complain is the lack of quality control. I started getting problems with the earbuds cutting off and sometimes they will get out of sync, which putting them back and pressing the case button three times seemed to fix it it was super annoyning...imagine having soapy hands or just busy and can't take them off right away while you got a mess of sound in your ears, it has lattency when you watch videos too. None of this ever happened with my jaybird vista for the 3 years I had them.Also I noticed that the left earbud led light was not aligned with the orifice like it should, so definetely a quality control issue. When I reset the earbuds the lights on the earbuds flicker but at different rates which lets me to believe something isn't right. Again the left one is flickering randomly faster than the right one. I watched do this for a while and could not identify the pattern...almost as they would somehow try to sync and stop and start over endlessly with no success.

There are fewer options for touch control, the sound quality and the ANC is not close to being as good as the Pro buds. They are more comfortable and the touch pad is more responsive, however. I have had difficulty getting the Minis to connect with my MacBook air while the Pros connect perfectly. Both connect with my iPhone 12 effortlessly, just not at the same time.

Initially worked great and stayed in my ears even while asleep. But within 2 months the maximum volume on one of the buds started to diminish. Then it got quieter in the other earbud. Eventually I had only one earbud that worked and it would barely emit any sound. I reached out to their customer service and they were able to send me a new one, but only after I jumped through a bunch of hoops and paid $12 to send them the broken one with trackable shipping with UPS since they needed a tracking #.The second set worked well about a month until the same thing happened with one of the earbuds getting quieter. Then one morning before work I plugged them in for about 15 minutes. I can't imagine what would have happened if I left them any longer, because when I grabbed the case, it was so hot that I burned my fingers (even left a mark for a few days).

Previous 1More earbuds I have purchased in the past were superbly packaged with great documentation. That was not the case 1More Comfobuds. The sound produced by the earbuds is good, not great. True to their name, they are very lightweight, a plus. But the documentation for this product is unacceptable in terms of the limited amount of information and the absurdly small type in the users manual. The documentation states that the earbuds come with replacement buds of a larger and smaller size, but there were none in my package. Nor is there an app associated with this device which allows you to adjust controls. So between the unreadable manual and the absence of an app, I had absolutely no idea how to adjust. For example, I had no idea how to activate or regulate the noise cancellation feature. I replaced these earbuds with 2nd Gen iPod Pros, at twice the price, but more than twice the value in comparison to the 1More Comfobuds.

So far, these have come the closest. I can wear them for like 2 hours with minimal discomfort. This is a huge upgrade from ""most cause physical pain near immediately"". When placed correctly, they're pretty solid. I couldn't shake them out. They did come loose a handful of times and needed to be readjusted, but in comparison to the others needing that every 5 minutes? I'll take it.They say they have ANC, but honestly, I'm not so sure. In my personal experience, turning ANC on didn't actually cancel any noise. It just brought the bass out. Unless I just can't get the right fit, the ANC mode is effectively just a ""make the music sound better"" button.The drawback here is that you can only use ANC if both buds are in. Not usually a problem, unless you want to pop one in to listen to music and leave the other ear open for communication. The make the music sound better button won't do anything with just one bud.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2022",AE7N2ACQHBB3J4PPIM7D3DXGRKXQ,1,19,Color: Black,236,1.0

From a technical perspective battery life, sound quality, and reliability were my major issues. I knew the batteries lasted less than 8 hours with anc on but personally think 8 hours needs to be the target to get you through long haul flights. Then comes the audio quality which is good but not great they do have an app to adjust the equalizer, though not directly, and it did make it sound better to my ears but still fell a bit flat. The final issue that I have gone through 2 pair in less than a month. It starts off as a low hum/click in the left ear bud when anc or passthrough are active that gets worse over time. It is low and might be missed by many but if you go through the reviews you will find others reporting the same issue. It appears many people either don’t have this problem or it doesn’t bother them so you might get lucky but at the MSRP it wouldn’t be worth the risk for me.On the positive side these buds are the smallest I have ever tried and I love them for that.m. Other than the slight ear pressure I have forgotten they are in. I also have found the ANC is reasonable but don’t perform anywhere close the Sony xm2 headphones.

I used these for a couple hours and the battery indicator still said 100%, and the sound quality was good. That being said, I found them very uncomfortable to wear and difficult to adjust. I have very small outer ears, and even though these are advertised as being good for small ears I found them very uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. The shape also makes them hard to put back in the case properly and figure out how they should fit in the ear, and I accidentally turned them off a couple times trying to adjust the fit, which was annoying.","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2024",AEUFMSWBL4XUSCR5OQ4BVPS5Z7AA,1,0,Color: Red,129,0.25

I tried two other models of earbuds, but the problem with them is that the volume could not be adjusted low enough. I looked at the imore comfoBuds Z, but they did not have a microphone and wanted to keep that option in my back up pair of earbuds.I purchased the 1MORE ComfoBuds Mini and they are comfortable - even a bit more comfortable than my airpods 2nd gen. I can reduce the volume to an acceptable 5% - they don't reduce in volume as well as my airpods that can get just a bit lower before muting, but better than any other. I wish they have the timer function that the comfoBuds Z have. The ANC is good. The Transparent listening modes is weird - some ambient noise in my home, like the refrigerator, gets louder. I don't think I'll use it much.

Not must of a real change other than the obvious smaller size and overall comfort. Wish the eartips we're a little better though. if you're worried about the lack of value you won't be upset. Having the sound ID as the only EQ is a bummer but it does a good enough job and simplifies the experience. The ANC is good and I'd say you're not going to be unhappy with them.

Lastly the transparency mode is just ok. You can hear things going on around you but its not perfect by far. The connection during phones calls has mixed reviews in my opinion.

The fit: the eartips come with it are TERRIBLE. Due to the small size, you need the good eartips to hold it in place. The tip size is not the issue here, but the design and material are just flimsy. If you pay for good external tip, then it will be great, but not for this price point.Pros: the sound quality is AWESOME. Loud, clear, great bass.

Tinny sound with no bass. When ANC was used, the sound got even worse and sounded as if it were coming from down a hallway. Oddly, one day the sound randomly improved dramatically. However, a couple of days later as other reviewers have complained they started having a horrific high-pitched squeal in the right earbud before it stopped working completely.Update: Amazon replaced my original pair with a new set. These were infinitely better than my original pair. They sounded completely different than before and quite honestly sounded amazing! Due to their small size I can wear them under my motorcycle helmet which I love. I’ve really loved these since October. However, the bad news is that once again they have broken. They currently have the exact same issue as my previous pair. The left earpiece has very muddy muted sound. If I turn on noise cancelling there is a loud high pitched squealing. Once again they are unusable. On a positive note when I contacted 1MORE about warranty service they were very responsive. So let’s go with pair #3 … hopefully this time they last.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2022",AEMFFA37K7IFRFCL7DB3PLYUMBVQ,1,1,Color: Black,202,0.0

They usually fit me poorly and hurt inside and around the outside of my ear canal even with the smallest tips. When I try to adjust wireless earbuds for comfort it causes them to pause my music. These wireless earbuds are tiny and lightweight. They come with different tips but I tried the standard tip that was already on them and they fit perfectly and painlessly!

Today most people don't know their name but they were The company that helped make android what it is today back when windows mobile was installed on 99% of portable devices.The buds are not the best on the market not even close. But these tiny little buds compete with them. Yup at $20 these buds have minimal latency & a rich harmony of sound. They are also pretty comfortable. They take a few seconds longer than preferred to pair each time I take them out of their case but that could also be my device so I don't consider that as a device issue. I've had some that have paired by the time I have the buds in my ear, these are still beeping for a couple seconds. Probably a total of 4-5 seconds total to connect. Not a huge deal but not preferred. They almost never disconnect & give me lossless sound at 15 distance from my device. So when I'm in the house listening to music these are still good. Touch controls are very sensitive so there's no need to press over an over they are very responsive. I bought these prima for music but wanted the voice controls as well. The noise cancelling could use some improvement. Most calls are great, but when in high wind they do not cancel the noise. Over all calls are just fine on these buds but could be a little bit better. I bought these for music anyway. Very small case so they are easy to lose but that's the standard for buds these days so I cannot count that against them either. In the end they sound pretty good across a variety of music genres rock, jazz, pop, classic, rap, blues, & R&B. They are not automatically variable across all audio formats so disparity is present between codecs & quality but most buds are this way even many more expensive ones. Most people just stream music anyway & won't notice the difference because this only matters if you own alot of your own music. In the end these are really good buds worth more than they are sold for. These aren't cheap buds these are solid quality buds. Htc hasn't sacrificed quality.

They keep lowering the quality of them. This generation of this product isnt worth having. The touch/tap controls simply don't work. It doesn't matter what the instructions say - it's only on/off.In addition, they're sensitive. Brushing against your ear (not tapping on the earbud) will stop your media or hang up your calls and in some frequent and infuriating cases - disconnects your earbuds from Bluetooth altogether. But tapping on them will not reconnect anything. :))))))I hate these I'm not buying them ever again.~~~~~(This product on the left. previous product, now removed,on the right.)My review for the previous model was a glowing review. The sound quality was great, the range was great, and an earbud *went through the washing machine* and still worked. 5* and chefs kiss.

The sound is not as great as the last model but this *is* about $10 cheaper. When in pairing mode - the earbuds make a loud beeping sound, nonstop, until paired. The downside is that you can't put your earbuds in and then pair Bluetooth because the noise hurts. The beeping is not loud enough to find a missing earbud.All in all,Cheers to HTC for making a product affordable and yet still better quality than the competition.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2022",AG3PFW7Q45G3N2MJJ3A2W5MKWQ6A,1,3,,245,0.25

I like them to be compact to fit under my helmet, have loud enough clarity that I can hear them over my bike's engine, be touch sentitive and not a button, and most importantly, be able to skip song tracks with a long button press as opposed to a double click. These fit every single box. They even make a light to let you know when you've changed tracks. This is important to me so I can tell when I successfully did skip to the next song and not accidentally pause my music instead. They were so close to perfection. Except for one major problem that ruins it for me. Any small drop, matter how light, will break it. I once dropped a bud while sitting down onto thick carpet and the sound went out in it. All other functions worked except it made no noise. I figured I got a defective product and Amazon was happy to replace it. I loved my second one until I dropped it on my bed and the earbud died again. If the maker made them any more durable, I would happily buy a third pair. They have good sound quality, are compact, great battery life, and have all the functions I want. However, any drop over 15 inches, no matter the surface will break their sound. Every other function in that dropped earbud will work but it will be completely muted. I truly wish I could give this product the 5 stars it deserves but after going through two of the same earbuds with the same issue, I simply can't do so. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 solely because of the audio and ticking off all my boxes. Unfortunately, because of it's fragility, I can't give it any better.

They're not expensive, and I was hoping for the typical good HTC experience I had gotten after owning several of their phones. These things kind of suck if you're trying to live life while using them. First, they put all the weight on the top of the bud, which means that any head movement loosens them in your ear. I tried all the sizes of cushion, and none of them keep them in my ear canal for more than a minute or two if I'm walking. I constantly have to push them back in. If my hands are full, for example - bringing groceries into the house, one or both will fall out. Riding my bike yesterday, I had one fall out on the cement trail, bouncing into the weeds. I stopped quickly which caused the other to fall out. I spent 6 minutes looking for the damn thing before finding it. I tried switching left and right which allows them to sit sideways in my ears, and it's a little bit better, but not enough. Also, they cut out a lot. If my phone is in my pocket just above my knee and I'm walking the sound cuts out to the rhythm of my steps. Charming. Same with riding my bike. Have to put it in my shirt pocket. Have not had this problem with other Bluetooth headphones.In conclusion, if you're in a coma, playing dead, or part of a freeze flashmob, they're pretty good.

The feel was cheap and they broke after dropping them. The sound was eh but absolute trash. I had to use the warranty to get a new pair and same issue. I had to eventually buy a new pair and I decided I wouldn't ever buy raycons again and since these were on sale for $60 I decided to give them a shot. I knew JBL was a great speaker and headphones brand so I wanted to give them a try. Omg they are the best earbuds I've ever had. They're so easy to connect to ur phone and you can change the sound profile from the app. The sound cancellation is like nothing I've ever had even better somehow than my gaming headphones I think. The bass is unreal!!! The sound clarity and everything is incredible. Best earbuds I've ever had. They are durable too. They feel like good quality and the case is perfect. It feels good it snaps shut and has a good satisfying feel and sound when it does. It fits perfectly in my pocket and the charge life is so fricken long I can go a week without charging it and it still has life. I've had these for about a month and only charged them maybe twice. I'm so happy with the way these are id highly suggest buying these. Especially over raycon earbuds. I'm so happy I helped people not waste their money on that crappy brand. Someone I talked to even canceled their order to buy a pair of these and thanked me because these were on sale for way cheaper. But even at base price for only a few dollars more why not buy quality?

201,R11OSJ184YK5L8,B09FM6PDHP,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality,Amazon Customer,5.0,"This review is representative of my first impressions after receiving the item.Fit - 4/5: While I've had better fitting earbuds in the past, I would say that these aren't problematic at all, but not perfect either. The buds fit fairly snugly in my ears, and its quite nice that they've included a few tips. They don't seem to move around if I shake my head, so I have decent confidence that if I take them to the gym or on a run, I wouldn't have problems. That said, they don't quite fit perfectly, but everyones ear is a bit different so others might find it better or worse.Sound - 5/5: All I can say is wow do I love the sound that these produce. The level of bass is far beyond anything that I've had from my other earbuds (Jabra Elite 65t and Jlabs JBuds Air). The app includes equalizer settings that actually make quite a lot of difference (unlike other headphone apps I have used) and I am blown away by how much bass can come from these headphones. I have also noticed with other wireless buds that they tend to be on the quiet side, not reaching the same volume that my larger Sony headphones can, but that is not at all the case here. These get LOUD. As someone who plans to mainly use these for workouts, this is exactly what I hoped for.Battery - 5/5: So far I have not had a chance to use these until they die, so I have to disclaim that. However, if the battery matches up or comes close to their claims, which I expect they will given it is a reputable brand, then I will be impressed. My other buds max out at around 8 hours, so getting almost 4x the total battery life is excellent. 8 hours without recharging is very impressive.Look and feel - 3/5: The case looks nice and I think the aesthetics are fine. But the buds themselves are polished smooth, which makes them a bit tricky to handle with your fingertips. Once they're in, its no problem. But a matte finish or some texture would have been better for usability.I'll update this review if I find any reason to, but I am extremely impressed by the headphones, especially for the price point. Highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AHDFGIHZLAWNS6GVEJFT6HO4JONQ,1,18,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,389,1.0

The quick start guide helped a ton figuring out all the controls, which is a must for me as I find I have a lot trouble figuring these types of things out.

So they get an A plus for adjustability in that regard.I love the color, I chose navy but there many to choose from.

Again very happy with the quality but more importantly for me is the battery life, these are very comparable with the higher end jlab buds that will last me the entire work day and have enough juice in the case so that I'm not having to charge them multiple times a week. These are amazing in both categories. And lastly you can listen to each bud independently which is a must for people like me that usually only wear one.

204,R1PDE5V244R06D,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars At 50% or more off, these are great.",Dru Ha,5.0,"I have one pair for work and one for home/going out. I wouldn’t have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair they’re a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds. Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3’s. I’m an audiophile on a budget. They can’t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds they’re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. I’ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think that’s due to the EQ setting I’ve selected. You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I haven’t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the “ambient-aware” or “talk through” modes. That’s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which don’t seem to have any functional ANC. I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. They’ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1. However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc. it’s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I don’t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2023",AFUR62MXQUALQJX5LDFW3KOQBQLA,1,99,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,462,1.0

This being said….About a month ago my right earbud started having connectivity issues with my Bluetooth (while my left earbud functions normally) and now has completely lost the ability to gain charge. So I’ve basically been down to one earbud which doesn’t allow any of the ambient sound controls and is honestly kind of annoying!I really never write reviews for anything, but I’m genuinely devastated because I loved these JBL earbuds so much and I really needed these to last me longer than 5 months.

206,R3U67WG7KC37BZ,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wow, these are good sounding earbuds",Mike,5.0,"There are review sites around that test headphones and earbuds and as far accuracy in frequency response and imaging, these earbuds outrank most other brand's more expensive earbuds.I have the JBL Tune 600BTNC headphones which are a great over the ear headphones and these earbuds sound just as good and even a bit clearer. That's hard to do. Both, these 230NC and the 600BTNC have bass between 20Hz and 100Hz elevated by 3db to 5db, the 230NC being a bit more accurate. That's Ok because I like my bass a few decibels higher.These earbuds have really good punch as well as ultra low bass down to 20HZ. Comparing these 230NC to your subwoofer is a great way to see how good or weak your subwoofer is. Since these 230NC earbuds are accurate from 20Hz to 60Hz within 1db or +4db above 100Hz, most subwoofers can't provide the bass these earbuds can.The clarity in the midrange and treble is great, and without elevation to make music sound bright and fatiguing.I have tried the JBL Club Pro Plus and Tune 125TWS and neither would seal correctly or be comfortable to wear more than 10 minutes. Mainly because of the big club at the end of the actual ear piece. Those earbuds don't fit good in every ear because they are big. The 230NC doesn't have club at the end of the earpiece but a small thin stalk like most ""wired"" earbuds that fit everyone good. These 230NC with their long thin stalks fit my ears good and seal good, plus they are actually more comfortable than my 600BTNC headphones. The Club Pro Plus actually hurt my ears and left them in pain for an hour after only wearing them for 10 minutes.These 230NC earbuds sound great, seal good, and are comfortable enough to wear for hours. I don't see doing any better than some $300 earbuds or headphone for sound quality.The one thing they fall down in and so do my 600BTNC is that they use the lower class active noise cancelling instead of the adaptive noise canceling. Honestly they sound great even in a noisy plant with the active noise cancelling.For the price slashing Amazon does to the retail price, they are a bargain IMO.The only thing I wish they had was function to test if they are sealed correctly like the Club Pro Plus had in it's app. That way you know you are getting the maximum bass response that these earbuds can produce. I simply test using music with ultra low bass that I'm very familiar with.","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2023",AF7UFK3GWNSBHUXMPCXJM5LZIKJA,1,38,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,428,1.0
207,R21G2QA3DWXAWV,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars A satisfactory pair of earbuds with a decent attempt at noise cancellation,Tonigiri,4.0,"In this review, I will compare the jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds with some of the best wireless earbuds of 2023, based on four criteria: noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, and design.Noise cancellation: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have active noise cancellation, which works well in most situations, but may not be effective in very loud environments. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with outstanding noise-canceling performance that adapts to your surroundings and personal preferences. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also excellent, with adjustable noise cancellation levels and a transparency mode. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is another good option, with effective noise cancellation and spatial audio support.Sound quality: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds deliver a decent sound quality, with a balanced and clear output. However, they may not satisfy audiophiles who prefer a more detailed and dynamic sound. The Technics EAH-AZ80 wireless earbuds are the best in this category in my opinion, with a superb sound quality that rivals some of the best over-ear headphones. They have a rich and balanced sound signature, with deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. They also support high-resolution audio codecs and have a dedicated app for EQ customization. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are also great, with a dynamic and engaging sound that can be tweaked via the Sony Headphones Connect app. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also impressive, with a top-notch sound quality that is well-balanced and natural. Keep in mind that the jbl 230 nc sits in a very different price point than the earbuds above so it's still punching way above its weight in this regard.Battery life: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a battery life of about four hours, which is average for wireless earbuds. They come with a charging case that can provide an additional 12 hours of playback. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with a battery life of up to eight hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 24 hours with the charging case. They also have a quick charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just 10 minutes of charging. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 are also good, with a battery life of up to six hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 30 hours with the charging case. They also support wireless charging and have a fast charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just five minutes of charging.Design: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a simple and sleek design, with a matte black finish and a jbl logo on each earbud. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear, with three sizes of silicone ear tips to choose from. They are also water-resistant, which means they can withstand sweat and rain. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is the best in this category, with a sleek and ergonomic design that fits snugly in your ears. They have an open design without tips, which means they don't block out the outside sound completely. They also have force sensors on each stem that let you control music playback, calls, noise cancellation, and voice assistants. The Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds are also stylish and comfortable, with a winged design that keeps them secure in your ears. They have an IPX4 rating for water resistance and have touch controls on each earbud.Conclusion: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds are a decent pair of headphones for casual listeners who want to escape the noise of the world. However, they are not the best in any category, and they face stiff competition from other models that offer better performance and features. If you want the best noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, or design, you may want to consider other options such as the Sony WF-1000XM5, the Technics EAH-AZ80, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2, or the Apple AirPods Pro 2. At this price point however, which is often lower (I bought mine on sale for 50% off), the jbl 230 nc is a no-brainer and will give you a value you can't say no to.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AEFYG6AEEKPWIUMDM2IYUSDK2FLA,1,140,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphones,695,0.75
208,R1PQYT04HC2P7L,B09FM6PDHP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Had high hopes, jury is still out.",Shonna,4.0,"I bought these to replace my skullcandy sesh Evo. I had the skillcandy for over a year & recently I lost the left bud & then the right ear bud decided it was gonna be finicky about charging. Like the sensor wasn't connecting properly anymore. It was getting super frustrating because I only had 1 ear bud left & when I wanted to use it it would either be dead or only give me a few minutes. After watching many reviews on YouTube & reading them here I decided I'd get these JBL ones as they had good reviews & *bonus* they were on sale for $49.00. I am on day 3 of using them. Around my house I normally only wear 1 ear bud so I can still keep an ear on my kids. I used the right ear bud all day yesterday, sticking it back in the case when not in use. Last night I went to use the left ear bud & it didn't automatically connect when I took it out like the right one. When I had both out it connected so I put the right back in the case. When I woke up this morning I went to use the left one & the app said it only had 20% battery even though it was in the charger all night. In messing with them I realized even in the case the left was still connected & playing. I finally got it to connect to the charger & work properly. But I feel like it shouldn't be this difficult. It's not rocket science placing the ear buds in the case. I am using these for music, podcasts, & watching shows. The sound is great. I haven't made calls with them. They fit comfortably in my ear, I like the black sleek color. I am just hoping I don't continue to have charging or connection issues as I will use these EVERY SINGLE DAY all throughout the day.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AEB4PHJN3LWFAU3TMAW2QU6XRTIQ,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,331,0.75

I wanted to replace a former set of earbuds with something more substantial and higher quality. I really love all that JBL does (I have purchased their FLIP bluetooth speaker as well and it's fantastic).However, for some reason, everything just crashed and burned suddenly. First, the left earbud stopped charging altogether (no light shows up even after cleaning the contacts). Then the charging case went entirely dead after just charging it to 100%. So I'm figuring it's the end. Sadly.I had figured a mid-priced brand would be a nice middle ground (somewhere between Tribit and Bose lol). I am not a power user and am very careful with my earbuds, so maybe this was just as long as these were going to live. I will keep buying JBL, but have to unfortunately add my voice of disappointment on these earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AEEKDCHLNPFK4YGNYN6QNS3JLYSA,1,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,153,0.75

If you want to shut the white noise off and have the right one in your ear you have to leave the left ear bud out of the case to shut the sound off which is only a matter of time until you loose it.

225,R2ALTJFGTU9XEY,B09FM6PDHP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Best battery life, Great noise cancelling, awkward fit in case",N8,4.0,"I have only used wired headphones for years. This is the first time I've ever purchased Bluetooth wireless ear buds - so, know going forwards that I don't have anything to compare these to.That being said, I do have a few pairs of Bluetooth wireless headphones, and I'm making some assumptions, based upon these.So, the first thing I'll say is that the Noise Canceling feature in these is downright amazing. I mean, for something so small to be able to block out so much noise is just quite unbelievable.In addition, the Ambient Aware mode is quite amazing as well, as you can literally hear everything around you, while still hearing the music quite clearly - you can tell that a lot of R & D went into these.The Talk Through mode is also good - although I think it makes the music so low that you really can't even hear it - but it is handy in case you need to have a conversation. I've had a conversation with Ambient Aware mode turned on, and I can hear the other person just fine.Okay, here is where I'll start making some assumptions. I don't have another pair of BT earbuds to compare to, so I'm assuming that other companies would create apps similar to the ones for their BT headphones when making apps for their ear buds.The JBL app is my favorite one. It's very easy to get into, has some settings you can change (like what each ear bud does when you touch it certain ways), as well as allows you to change the audio mode that you've enabled.Now, I have a pair of Anker BT headphones, and they are really comfy, but the app is nowhere near as feature-rich as the JBL app is.I guess if there is anything that I don't like about these it would be the inability to turn them off without using the app. You can set them to time out after a set amount of time, so they would turn themselves off at some point, but I think that is a waste of the battery, so I use the app to turn them off.Another thing I don't like is the case - the ear buds fit into it in a very awkward way - I'm always having to twist my wrists to get them in correctly. I think this was a major design flaw, but it's minor compared to all the other benefits of these.One thing I absolutely love on these is the battery. I've used these for about an hour, turned them off (via the app), kept them outside of the case, and come back to them a month later, and they are still at the same battery percentage as a month ago - unbelievable.I should also mention that the battery lasts a fair amount of time when actually listening to them. I use these when working out, and they last plenty of time for me to run and lift weights.I've never actually tried to figure out exactly how long they last on one charge, but if I'd have to guess, it's probably upwards of 5 hrs at least.To save battery power, I usually put mine in a ziplock bag, along with the case - so that the battery gets to run-down without being recharged all the time. I only put them back into the case when the battery is actually low.The case also charges very quickly (as do the ear buds as well).So, overall, I'd highly recommend these ear buds. They have some minor issues that I've discussed, but in my opinion, the pro's far outweigh the con's for these.If you found this review helpful, please click on ""helpful"" or the thumb's up.Thanks.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023",AEVRSFNYMIZ3OQFLXTDUEWLZW7YA,1,283,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,621,0.75

Sitting on my bike with the engine running but not moving the active noise cancellation seemed to work very well - I couldn't hear the engine at all, actually - but once I started moving things weren't quite so rosy. It seems the active noise cancellation is just a tad too slow to respond to wind buffeting noise because the music is horribly distorted as if one is listening to speakers through the spinning blades of a fan. Unfortunately, with the active noise cancellation turned off the silicone cup style earplugs don't do near as good a job of passively blocking ambient sounds as the silicone triple-rib style earplugs on the MiPeace (or the Elgin's I replaced these with), so I reluctantly returned them.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AFULIFC3V2ECRHMU7GIFX6PYSOHQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,178,0.5

Also I felt the fit of the JBL earbuds were more comfortable than Sony which are much smaller.Note its important to turn on the noise cancellation feature and also adjust your music preference in the EQ settings... through the JBL app for the best outcome.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AEVW4FF2PZC6HAC2Y4PSS5R4NPRQ,1,26,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,150,1.0

247,R1E98JJK30KTBI,B09FM6PDHP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Weird Quirks",Love,4.0,"Pros:- Sound quality is awesome! Love the ability to use the app for EQ.- Noise cancellation is superior! (So great for shopping during the holidays, you can block out all the crowd chatter and repetitively Christmas music!)- Ability to switch noise cancellation modes is easy! (So you can optionally listen to people speak while cutting out a few decibles like fan noise.)- Build quality is solid!- The JBL app works flawlessly!- They connect to phone and other devices easily, total plug & play!Cons:- They tend to disconnect more often, which isn’t that annoying per se — except it makes a beep sound to alert you that something is wrong. (The Apple earbuds just turn off, so there’s no jarring loud beep in your ears.) This is especially annoying when it happens in the middle of a song.- This one is weird — If you hold the two earbuds in your hand, and they touch in a certain way, it makes a loud chirping noise. (Almost like the feedback of two microphones being too close together.)- They’re kind of bulky, and fall out of my ears more often than the Apple AirPods did. Even after changing the rubber tips. (The bright side is that because they’re so bulky, they’re easier to find on the ground.)- Though you can use the JBL app to find your earbuds, it doesn’t help you find the charging chase.Conclusion:- For $50, I’ll keep ‘em! The sound quality is truly excellent enough to look past the weird quirks.And if they get lost, as most earbuds often do, it won’t break my wallet to do so. (The Apple ones are comfy and have less quirks, but kind of overrated at that price point.)So I would buy JBL earbuds again — though I might look into the smaller models, that maybe (hopefully) aren’t as prone to pop out of the ear like a cartoon bean.","Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AFZYWTX4DWEYTGWMVJVRWCJBXPIA,1,50,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,316,0.75

253,R1IG9HV4RNJRWA,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing,Ken,3.0,"There are several things I like about the JBL 230. The sound quality is pretty good and the noise cancelling is excellent for this price range. So, if you're in a noisy office or work environment, these may work for you. The battery life is great, and the JBL app provides a good equalizer for customizing your sound. I love the blue color, and the touch controls work, even if finding that ""sweet"" spot takes a bit of practice.What I don't like is that every time you put the earbuds in, they start in the ""Ambient Aware"" mode (sounds around you are amplified). It's great, if you want to hear what Margret down in accounting thinks about Bob's new haircut from across the room, but I hate it. I'm typically putting in earbuds to block out the sound around me, not to make it louder. Plus, the Ambient Aware function uses battery life. I'd much rather have the ability to start in a ""normal"" (non-amplified) setting, but that's not available. You have to start with them active and either open up the app to turn it off or set the buds to use a touch feature to turn it off (meaning you can't use the touch feature to control your music, change volume or anything else).My second gripe is around the microphones and wind. Any slight breeze makes it impossible for you to be heard at the other end of a phone call. I'm often outside and I simply can't make phone calls if there's a breeze. Likewise, driving with the windows down while on the phone is a no-go. The wind drowns out everything else. If you happen to have Ambient Aware turned on (remember, it's the default?), it amplifies that wind noise in your ears, as well, even if you're not on the phone. This is a real deal breaker, and everyone from Apple to Samsung and Sony do a much better job of limiting wind noise on phone calls with their buds.There are other minor things. The buds are very lightweight, which is good, but they stick a little too far out of my ear, so they're always getting knocked loose. They sit in the case with the speakers facing outward, so you always have to turn them around when taking them out or putting them away, since most people are designed with their ear canals going *in* to their heads (this design makes zero sense). The app is slow to load. You can't do anything in the app until it finds and connects to your buds, so you have to have at least one bud in to use the app for anything, which is weird (I can't even view the app right now to tell you about it because my buds are at home, so the app won't open), and many app features aren't accessible unless you have both buds in.I really wanted to like these, but the inability to use them in 90% of the cases I want them just makes them worthless to me.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AFKKJU65DENPLES5WGHT46LVPJJA,1,129,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,510,0.5

The charging lights on the case have began to malfunction.

I've had them for a year now and they work wonderfully. The audio quality is great, not the best but worth the price. They fit into my ears wonderfully and don't slip out easily which is quite rare for me. The Bluetooth range also seems to be quite large and I never have issues with that.One other thing is that the battery has definitely dwindled rapidly in the past year, but I use these earbuds everyday for at least a few hours, so that's to be expected. I don't mind charging them more often. The earbuds themselves still last about five to seven hours on a full charge, which is absolutely perfect for me.I like these earbuds a lot.

I had the microphone just straight up gave up in the middle of a call and had to restart my computer to get it back to work again, unpair and pair didn't work. Occasionally, they randomly disconnect for a second or so, like every couple of hours on average. When that happens, there's a chance for one ear bud to be slightly delayed than the other, and has to unpair and pair to fix.If you use both earbuds all the time, then it's great for $50-60. 5/5Comfortably fit in my ears and don't fall out much when jogging. They'll still fall out when the moving is too much, but that's unavoidable in any earbuds like this. ANC works wonders. The sound quality is good for the price. Microphone is hit and miss like every other earbud out there, but generally works well.If you ever use just the right earbud, then it's awful. 0/5The ambient aware gives out a very audible white noise all the time. And it will automatically be turned on if you only use the right earbud. You cannot turn it off because the ambient aware setting is on the left earbud only. You can only turn that off in the phone app. But if the earbud is not connected to the phone, then you can't change it.One work around is to go to the phone app and let both earbud to have the ambient aware on off functions, but you will lose the right earbud's play/pause function. And you need to turn it off every single time you use it.The connection chime and setting change chimes are extremely loud and I can't find a way to lower the volume. So that's further annoyance. This applies to both single and both earbuds modes.I personally hate these and will be returning the earbuds.

That would be a pair of L26 speakers, I purchased on lay-a-way, when I was 16, back in 1976 for $875. That would be over $6000 in 2023 dollars. Later I purchased JBL's J2050 Book-Shelf speakers and later still JBL's Media 100 Desk-Top speakers. I guess you would say, I would recommend JBL products, since I've had a 48 year relationship with their brand.I was on the brink of returning the JBL Tune 230NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Ear-Buds but decided to contact JBL Customer support, to find out why I was unable to connect my ear-buds to my TV. I submitted a fairly detailed explanation, sufficient for their support staff to realize I was already paired to my phone. So I learned that ear-buds come in single-pairing and multi-point-pairing. The JBL Tune 230NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Ear-Buds are single-pairing, which is just fine for me. These ear-buds can be very immersive, watching TV or Listening to music. The noise cancellation does a nice job of muffling surrounding noise. I had taken them with me on walks to listen to music or books-recordings and I became a bit concerned at how much of the sound around me was deadened. You then have to keep your head on a swivel.As these are my first ear-buds, I don't know if this is common but while out for a walk, the microphone ports, built into the ear-buds, pick up and transmit the sound of the wind scouring the microphone ports.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGJRRXVA43IHAW4WHREBWAXE2GYQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,266,1.0

302,R3UK6JSSN2LFZ2,B09HN594TL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good inexpensive earbuds.,nekoBasu,4.0,"I recommend these as an inexpensive earbud set.I like that they're red, so that stand out on my messy desk.I needed a new set to of earbuds, and decided Apple wasn't getting any more of my money in this space. I'm not thrilled with the longevity or support apple provides for their airpods pro.I found these on a list of of good cheap earbuds, and I'm happy. They work fine at the gym. out of the box, with the default rubber ear tips, I ran a mile on the treadmill this morning and I didn't fiddle with these once (for fit). They stay right where they're supposed to, which is not something I can say for airpods pro or another pair of earbuds I'd been using at the gym.These are not audiophile grade headphones. if you want that, keep looking. They do isolate pretty well. The base on the bass boost eq setting is just ok. But the sound is balance enough that it's not overly ""tinny"". I hate cheap speakers, and these don't sound too cheap. So while it's not the finest sound ever, it's still far from junk.Technically, coming from airpods, there are two downsides I've noticed (both survivable).1 - with my fingers - the buds themselves are very hard to remove from the charging case. If I never had owned airpods, I'm not sure I would know this. on the other hand, I think they seat really nicely in the case, and thus they always charge. The airpods famously don't always connect inside their case and sometimes aren't charging when you think they are. I'm ok with it, and I assume I'll eventually learn the ""trick"" to pulling these guys out with ease.2 - these were very easy to pair to my iphone. HOWEVER, unlike airpods, once these are paired to a device, they CANNOT be paired to another device unless they bluetooth connection is disconnected from the first device. e.g. with airpods, you can go back and forth between a macbook, an iphone, and an ipad, simply by selecting the airpods from the device. With these, if I was using them with my iphone, and then I want to use them with my ipad, I need to turn bluetooth off on the iphone for a moment until the buds are ""free"", and then I can connect them to my ipad. Sub-optimal, but not a deal breaker for me./a few pluses.1 - I can side-sleep with these in and they don't hurt. yay.2 - I love that the usb charging plug is integrated into the case. last thing I need is more cables.3 - again, for me, they fit well. Snug, almost to the point of being too big, but they don't bother me. I'm really impressed that they just stay put while I'm running and I don't need to constantly push them back into my ears for fear that they'll fall out./I haven't really had these long enough to have an opinion on the battery life.I haven't tried using these for calls yet, so no opinion on the microphone.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AGILVFT4SJ2DBC5KKWH6WSVY6LGQ,1,123,Color: RoseStyle: Pop,513,0.75
303,R3UWOH4RB5J595,B09HN594TL,5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: First Impressions,MayBae,5.0,"UPDATE:My AirPods are dying and have been constantly dropping Bluetooth with my phone, so I borrowed these from my daughter to wear for the day. I have had the right bud in for 7.5 hours and the battery percentage (which actually does show up on my phone screen in the control center) shows that I still have 40% battery life left. I also have not dropped Bluetooth once (!) and they still feel comfortable and light in my ear. I’m pretty astounded, actually. My AirPods would have died hours ago. The only issue I had was when I received a phone call. My phone rang, as well as hearing the ringing through the earbud, but when I answered, it did not automatically connect to the earbud at all. I had to talk into the phone normally. I also have noticed a distinct difference in the bass level between these and the AirPods. I don’t know how much of it has been the slow death of the AirPods, but these sound so much better than the first time I tried them. 10/10. Do it.Old Review:I heard these were a pretty decent earbud set for the price and decided to try them out as a backup set. I’m coming from AirPod Pro (1st Generation) and prior to that, the Jabra 75t.I have to admit, this isn’t bad for a $25 set of earbuds. One of the reasons I switched from the Jabra 75t’s (aside from the fact I had to get warranty replacements TWICE), was because I wanted to be able to use each earbud interchangeably and Jabra did not have that at the time. I’m actually quite surprised that JLab included the functionality for this price point. The charger being built into the bottom of the case was a nice touch and I appreciate that both earbuds go in the case magnetically, as well as the lid being magnetic as well. It paired easily with my iPhone 15 Pro and my daughter’s iPad.These are definitely lighter than both my Jabras and Pros. They fit in the ear nicely and I could see myself being able to wear them for a while (doing most things) and not have them fall out. My ears must be different sizes because my Pros consistently fall out of my left ear, but stay pretty good in my right ear.There isn’t an app for these, so while you can change songs, adjust volume, and use Siri by pressing the buttons on the earbuds, you won’t be able to tweak any part of the sound. You also will not be able to check the battery percentage and will have to go off the audio prompts it gives you. These also do not have noise-cancelling capabilities (which I honestly wouldn’t expect at the low price).So, here’s where I’m taking off one star…the sound. I’m not an audiophile. I don’t typically listen to music so the majority of my use is podcasts, audiobooks, or YT/Twitch vids. The sound is a bit muted (…not an audiophile) and not quite as clear as my Pros. For that reason, I likely will not use them unless I need to charge both my Pro earbuds at the same time…and both my Jabra’s are dead, haha. They would be fine in a pinch, but not something I would choose if my Pros are available.I also cannot speak to the battery life as I haven’t used them for more than a couple minutes, but what they promise (32 hours) is extremely impressive. I ended up giving them to my daughter to use as she only has over the ear headphones. I will say it’s a great first set of earbuds for kids as you do get a lot of great features in a lower priced set.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AFM6HO7FF4655PMXN7TUUKEIJ6UQ,1,7,Color: LilacStyle: Pop,630,1.0

306,R39862E1J269M4,B09HN594TL,"3.0 out of 5 stars There may be better (lightning?) deals on buds out there, but these are decent for the price",Xmetal,3.0,"Feb 2024: I am not sure if my current issue is fixable but maybe a day or two ago i noticed the right bud is not working ... it seems to be normal when i put it in the case but it never turns on anymore. The left bud is a-ok. Really this didn't last (note: i did get these used-like new and i have used them a bit) as long as I'd hope but it doesn't change my opinion. For the price (say $19.99) you can do better .. even if you have to wait for say a lightning deal on something like the TOZO T6's for $22.99 or something ... BUT ... i'd not say ""these are horrible, avoid"" ... the sound isn't the best like i said but they are small and really comfortable ... and while they dont have the best sound ... i have heard FAR worse ... just a little EQ'ing and these sound decent for relaxing music (one of my main uses) .. for podcasts or something ... that doesn't matter as much anyway (EQ'ing them) .... I will update this if i find its an easy fix but even a few resets hasn't gotten the right but to turn on yet.April 2023 Update: well ... I see these are $23 now ... I dont think they are worth that much (just a few $1's too high, dont get me wrong) ... but I got mine used-like new for $12.50 and I have seen them say at the $16 or so range ... you know .. these aren't 'great"" but they are not that bad. I think say for podcasts or whatever they are fine ... you can just find better for music (even ""jlab signature"" and eq'ed on top). having said that ... I have used these at night for sleeping and they fit great. I HAVE gotten use to being careful with the built in cable (still not a fan of that though ... if a cable breaks you can replace it... if this breaks, your charging case cant charge the earbuds).I hate to act like any of the buds I still have are ""not comfortable"" but for me, comfort wise, these are up there. As long as you dont expect these to be top quality buds (NOR worst of the low price buds, again dont get me wrong) .. I think people may like theseUpdate 2+ condensed) After using these for a bit, and even counting the best EQ option (Jlab Signature) and a v-shaped EQ on top via Wavelet (app) these still do not sound as good as some other pairs i have, however using them for side sleep (whatever side faces the pillow DOESN'T have an earbud in), these do a surprising good job at passive noise cancelling for me. While they also dont sound the best... they dont sound ""bad"" either ... you can some real no-name duds below $20, .. these are decent for that sub $20 price range to be clear.I gave these 3 out of 5 stars but really its maybe between a 3.5 TO MAYBE a 3.75 to be clear ... maybe more toward 3.5 in my book though. I'd say look at TOZO first for deals ... but I still recommend these.They are comfortable to me too ... like they dont feel too big ... just right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 1) I did notice one day when it was REALLY humid the controls seem to get wonky ... like sometimes my presses weren't ""registering"" and then others would which would mean i'd do a function (change track for instance) when i wanted to change the EQ mode instead... it doesn't alway happen but it has once or twice in constant use since i bought these.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i have to say the default tips + the size of the buds combo are nice ... I have ( .. even just to test THESE) been using these sleeping at times rather than my TOZO T6's and while i love the T6's i haven't found the ""perfect"" eartips for them that fit me (so to speak) ... at times with these Go Air Pops ... I hardly notice they are in my ears ... I didn't even open the little bag with the other tips to make sure (note: bought ""used - like new"") I got the other tips, yetmy one con that I REMEMBER typing this update is the sound quality ... .ok for the price on ""JLab Signature"" EQ but bang for your buck ... counting deals on Amazon ... you may be able to do better.So far Battery Life seems decent enough ... a little shorter than I expected but like i said i am using these for sleep and i count that time that I am sleeping so .... yeah battery life is good for the price, I'd say--------------------------First I want to mention this is all based on my first impressions after a few hours of use, only … things may change later. Bluetooth Earbuds I have are TOZO’s T6’s and NC2’s (two pair now), Fiil’s T1XS with app support, and Edifier’s TWS1 Pros and Earfun wise the Air Free Pro 2’s, (Returned due to a number of issues) Earfun Free Mini’s and to be clear… Earfun Free’s that were sent to me unexpectedly after they saw my review of the Free Mini’s (thank you Earfun) … point being is that I have experience with a number of earbuds even if I do use some more than the others (no real particular reason).Right away I noticed these opinionsPros- Fit – to be clear none of the buds I have are really “uncomfortable” in any way but these just fit good, with the default tips … or what I am guessing is the default tips (comparing them to the default TOZO T6 tips, they seem the same size) …. Unless my ear starts to itch or something, I HARDLY notice the Go Air Pops are in my ears. I love my TOZO T6’s (form factor wise the nearest on the list I mentioned, to the same form factor as these)… but these just seem to fit a little better.Update a few days later (after writing the prior paragraph) – these while they have fallen out from time to time… these are very comfortable. When using them for sleep (whatever side of my head faces the pillow if “side sleeping” doesn’t have an earbud in) … they are more comfortable then the TOZO T6’s I have used for the same thing before and with these there are times I barely know they are there, and I really like that.- Build quality – I will not say these have “great” build quality .. that just seems to be overstating it but these do not feel as cheap as the Earfun Air Free Mini’s. Some ultra budget earbuds have a quality where it just feels like the cheapest plastics and materials were used … not the case with these buds, even if they don’t scream ‘high end quality” either.- Battery Life – I am not going to act like I have counted or even really paid attention but these seem to last awhile and even after falling asleep for a bit with these… I cant say I have ever woken up to them NOT playing … since I bought them I had to charge them once and (just in case, I probably didn’t have to) then a second time, just to make sure the case was fully charged at that point, but I just had no idea the case’s charge then and it could have been say 70% or something and the second charge was un-needed.I’d say I am “impressed” by the battery life being good.------------------------------Pros/Con (??) – This may be my least favorite sounding earbud I have but … from what I remember of the Earfun Free Mini’s … they do sound better than they did … and I love TOZO but I can not compare these with the TOZO A1’s which I don’t have …. say comparing these to the TOZO T6’s seems sort of unfair as the A1’s (TOZO brand wise) are more of the equivalent to the Go Air Pops. They could sound the same for all I know.I do notice a difference using the built in EQ’s (note too that no matter the headphone or earbud I tend to have an EQ setting or app with a “U” to a “V” setting applied) … but not much … I do agree that the Bass Boost mode CAN muddy things up at times … the Flat EQ setting …. makes it a lot flatter sounding (no matter what I listened to) than I was expecting … I mean FLAT sounding … NOT “neutral” like I’d describe the TOZO T6’s for example.The best setting between the three is Jlab’s Signature sound which boosts the Bass and the Treble in a V like sound signature. Like the Fiil T1XS’s many EQ options and customization, for instance are nice to have, in my view … the default sort of “V” signature THEY offer is also the best THEY sound. If I am not mistaken .. the “Jlab signature” sound EQ setting IS the default and it does sound the best, like I said.After a few days and a “side-by-side” comparison to the TOZO T6’s I have (some of the others are in a higher price bracket … I am trying to be fair here) the T6’s do sound “sharper” and “crisper” …. sort of hard to describe if you don’t get what I am saying … however, forgetting these I got “used-Like new” for $12.50 … I’d sort of say they are worth $19.99 (typical price) … but I’d HONESTLY spend a tad more for the T6’s ….if someone did ask me about these “go air pops” ...”yes or no, at 19.99?… no commentary” … I’d say yes … if you note the con’s (below)----------------------------------------------------------------Cons- The built in charging cable. - I do have to admit I KNEW about this before hand and this was not a surprise …..A) the length … I mean many earbud’s cable that comes included IS short, but this seems extra short. I may pickup usb “extension cable” to use with these buds which ACTUALLY may solve the other issue …. anyway I just do not like how short this is, where depending on how you are ABLE to charge this, the case has to be dangling somewhere with all the weight of the buds and the case on the built in cable. To keep it as a built in cable I know they HAVE TO make it small or double/triple the size of the case itself … that makes sense to me … but I’d just rather have a say separate USB-C port + cable for instanceB) I didn’t even think of this at first but with the prior Jlab model that didn’t have a top on the case (not sure who’d like that design idea) … but the built in charging cable the way Jlab has it, has the bottom (even when it’s tucked into the case) pins exposed… .this seems like a really bad idea for dust/dirt/etc to me but for the record I have only just gotten these and NOT had issues with this yet … just something that seems like an oversight or something.- Max Volume - this may or may not always be an issue but especially if you have audio that is not normalized (the default level of the source audio is too low vs what it should be) ... the max volume of these earbuds may not help.I never truly paid attention to reviews saying how loud certain buds are, but I do notice that compared to some earbuds, the MAX volume of these or even ""on tick down"" from max is what i have it on a bit (note: sometimes i do have a black Honeywell fan on next to me) .... when some other buds ... say oh 70% to max (guessing, but it's close) is good for me volume wise. Again this is not always an issue with good source audio or if your not in a loud/noisy place-----------------------------------------Summary (again based on first impressions)I think if you count lightning deals there may be better options when others go on good sales, but these aren’t bad. I can “deal with” the sound not being the greatest, but that charging cable A) being so short and B) the pins being completely exposed I do not like and maybe a deal breaker for some.I can’t say I 100% recommend (I mean counting deals there are better options out there .. even for a LITTLE BIT more in price)… nor can I say I don’t recommend (even with issues like I said) … they aren’t bad … as a backup pair or if you are just curious about theses … I’d say go ahead and give them a shot.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2022",AHSKKWKFQ2CEAY2OXB7YBOKFD2KA,1,283,Color: BlackStyle: Pop,2172,0.5

308,R1Y33AFMMLBEV0,B09HN594TL,"4.0 out of 5 stars For $25 they're pretty decent, but there could be room for improvement.",Nightweeb92,4.0,"I've mostly ever bought Skullcandy headphones as they were generally my ""go to"", I went through about four of their sets before getting fed up with their odd spec listings at certain prices and annoying customer service and warranty.I needed something decent but cheap. The go air pop ended up being a popular choice so I picked them up. Generally I mainly use them for commutes and mowing the lawn (my ears start ringing after long periods of time with a lawnmower so I listen to music to avoid it).The price is great, getting these on sale is even better. They're super light weight and the fit is perfect and they stay in my ears pretty well if I'm not doing extenuous activities that make me sweat, otherwise I'm often pushing them back in, but I do sometimes have a small hassle getting them out of my ears and sometimes the case itself too. They fit in my ear a little too well that I sometimes have to get a good pinch grip to get them put, sometimes it feels like I'm not even wearing them.The build is about as expected, made with a higher grade plastic, they don't particularly feel expensive but they don't feel like dollar store cheap either, they look pretty decent ..though for the case I do wish there were a few changes. For one being the USB cable, instead of having a proprietary cable, they should just have a USB-C charging port instead. Additionally, it would've been nice to get maybe another 1 or 2 LED battery indicators in the front instead of the single one to let users know how much battery life is left in the case.On the inside they should add a recessed section to make it easier to pull the buds out of the case, I sometimes don't have good grip and the buds feel slippery, so I feel like I need to twist the buds to get them out. As for the flip top, they could make the recessed lip a little deeper, the case itself is decent but it's a little too slim that you sometimes fumble with keeping It open to get the buds out, it's sometimes just as slippery as the buds.The touch controls are pretty straight forward and easy to get used to.Sound is good ..if you're mostly into bass heavy stuff, they have a bit of clarity and some detail, but they're not something an audiophile would approve, they're just good general consumer quality. The original go air pop don't have an app so the only customizing users are limited to are the three built-in EQ settings, jlab signature/balance and bass boost.The Jlab signature sound is balanced with a slight bump in bass and treble, they're recommended as a universal sound that sounds good with just about anything. But to me it lacks clarity as some frequencies sometimes tend to mask or overpower other frequencies causing a loss in details.Balanced, is basically a flat meant for things like listening to audiobooks and podcasts, there's more focus and emphasis on boosting vocals while everything else remains relatively flat.Bass boost, is more for people who want more bass ..on top of what already feels like a more than enough bass sound from the Jlab signature sound. It's more meant for working out, but it does have a tendency to overpower the mids and highs most of the time and is the least detailed.Overall sound is good, stick with the Jlab signature sound and that's all you should really need. What the regular go air pop lacks is an EQ to help bring in more details. The Go pop+ is the same model but with a USB-C cable attached and allows connection to the Jlab app for custom EQ.One small gripe I have in color is that they don't have a mint color available for this set (or maybe not yet).And my other small gripe is this only support SBC audio encoding and not AAC which is a step up in audio quality. Yes that means the Go pop+ too only supports SBC. At this price I can't expect this to have something like LDAC support, but the inclusion of AAC would've been nice.Despite my gripes and nit-picks, for the price these are pretty decent and I'd recommend them if you're looking for something decent but cheap, I personally recommend going with the updated Go pop+ as they're the same as the go air pop but with app support and USB-C.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AHBH456GHSTRY32NAQBKZU6SJY5A,1,6,Color: SlateStyle: Pop+,753,0.75

I’m not terrified about losing them like I was with the more expensive ones. They fit snugly (but not too tight) and I haven’t had any issues with them falling out. The only reason that I didn’t give them 5 stars is because I find them to be a bit difficult to remove from the case. I also don’t love how you charge them. It would be easier for me if you could just plug a cord into the case as opposed to plugging the case directly into the c block as the plug in attached to the case is stiff and difficult to pull out from the case. These are the only issues that I have with these ear buds. In all fairness I also have neuropathy in my hands so this is probably a specific issue for me personally.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AHPOWAVYU2RIPWGTZHRF4IWDVSLQ,1,0,Color: SlateStyle: Pop,158,0.75

312,R3C1E4RID4SDBR,B09HN594TL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Enough,Catherine Green,4.0,"I'm not good at discerning audio quality, but these earbuds are ever so slightly worse quality than my expensive headphones. But like for the price, that's to be expected. They're good enough for when I don't want to use the bulky headphones.They also don't have a great range. They'll be fine if I walk across the room, but if I start going behind objects or down a hallway, the sound will start to skip a bit. But again, they're fine enough for the price. If you use them with your phone and carry it with you, they'll be fine.I saw someone else say these made their ears itch. Mine itch a bit while using these too, but my ears are sensitive. I only use 1 earbud at a time anyway, so I just switch them out for the other ear when it starts to get itchy after an hour or two. I think that might just be earbuds in general that do that, but I like that I can easily switch them out.I really like that they automatically connect when you remove them from the case, you don't have to turn them on. If they don't detect any paired devices, they automatically enter pairing mode which makes them super easy to use.The magnets in the case are strong and it's a bit hard to take the earbuds out sometimes.For the price, these are great. I hope they last me awhile.Edit: After 2 months, I still like these earbuds. I rarely have to charge them. Occasionally while using them with my TV, the audio starts getting choppy. Putting the earbuds back into the case to disconnect them, then taking them out so they automatically reconnect again seems to fix the problem. Again for the price I think they're adequate for me.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AFK53FA6BDBFPTFOUT66CQ4QLIFQ,1,2,Color: My Little PonyStyle: Pop,300,0.75

Being an Apple and tech snob I thought there is no way these could be great like all the reviews said. My AirPods quit working after a few years and at the time I wasn’t wanting to shell out hundred or more dollars for new ones. I ordered these to wear around the apartment while I clean and when I exercise at the gym. I got them in the mail very fast. When they came I fell in love with the lavender color so much I’ve tried to make it my new signature color for everything lol They are beautiful not only in color but also design. I was being kinda bummed about it having an attached USB cord but once I started using them it has become one of my favorite things about them. When I turned them on and added them to my iPhone fairly quickly and they continue to connect without any issues. Super easy. They fit amazing and come with different size ear pieces. The sound quality for the price that I paid is outstanding. They aren’t completely as loud as probably more expensive brands but I can definitely afford new AirPods Pro’s but I have remained more than happy with these and they have lasted me for longer than I thought and saved so much money.

These don't do that so every time you remove it to have a conversation or it falls out, your audio keeps playing.

They fit very well in the ear and the touch controls are pretty neat. I think one of my favorite features is the “be aware” mode where you can basically turn off the sound cancellation and be aware of your surroundings. Speaking of which, the sound cancellation is great! i can’t hear anything besides my music playing when it’s on. The quality of the audio itself is really really good—a huge upgrade from my previous earbuds. The bass is great and the sound’s pretty crisp and clear. All in all, i’d give these a 9.5-10. I’d definitely recommend them!","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AEO3F7A56JW2WGY5ESBAETCO6OSA,1,0,Color: Fruity PebblesStyle: Pop,117,1.0

Great sound, easily chargeable and I’ve never had a pair of headphones for this long. I use them with my iPhone 14+ and they work great and the color is cute. One thing I will say is since I use them every day, cleaning them is a must. The speaker screen has fallen off a couple times but I am able to place it back correctly after cleaning and put the ear bud back on. Also the longer you use them the faster you have to recharge them every night, but for the first 6 months I could go days without charging, but again I use them every day so maybe they’re just getting old. I love these, and will buy another pair whenever they choose to stop working but still going strong!","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFDEWTFOIXL3G5BGIT4W4NDYS2UQ,1,1,Color: LilacStyle: Pop,158,1.0

Next step was to get them out of the case and try them out. That was a bit more difficult then I expected…had a tough time getting them out of the case. The buds kept slipping out of my fingers. Didn’t expect that, but eventually got them out. Oh, kudos for the built in usb plug on the case although some people may not appreciate the “old” usb a plug. I didn’t care, so I was happy to just plug the unit into a charger.Now to actually test the buds out. Simple connect to Bluetooth, fired up a music streaming app and….then spent a half hour trying to fit the buds in my ear! Eventually had to switch the ear pads to a smaller size, and was ready to go!Listened to a few tunes…sounded ok, but a bit “thin” and a little bright. But I had the next day to really give the buds a listen! Turns out, bad decision. Next morning I started to listen in earnest, various genres of music, at different volume levels. Everything was going great until I got the bright idea of testing out the buds while mowing my lawn! Yeah, bad, really bad moves. Lost one of the earbuds somewhere in my back yard! Spent hours crawling all over the yard with my cellphone trying to “connect” Bluetooth to the missing earbud! It’s gone, now days later the battery in the earbud has surely died, to be found nevermore!Hence the 3 stars for initially sounding ok but being a pain to fit them in my ear! Oh and I also learned listening to one earbud is no fun!","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AELMQSKLUI2ODHOK6YRNUAI6MCFA,1,0,Color: ClearStyle: Pop,295,0.5

I will say, there is a slight learning curve in getting them to stay in your ears, you lowkey have to put them in and twist them a little to get them in the right spot. But once you get them in right they don't fall out! 100% would purchase again.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AEUYULJAUIFPSSWWV7TXKKO24TTQ,1,1,Color: VioletStyle: Pop,117,1.0

400,RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5.0,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2277,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,731,1.0
401,R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5.0,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,1,562,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,527,1.0

403,R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4.0,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,391,0.75

405,R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3.0,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,65,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,475,0.5

Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4.0,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,1,1697,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,524,0.75
408,R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4.0,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and it’s there for both buds plus case.They’re not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. They’re more noise reducing, so if that’s your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again it’s just enough to say it’s there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than what’s pictured.They’re extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it. I can honestly forget them in my pockets from how light they are.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AHPNYX3N7YSFKEGN2VREBPXEGT7A,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,303,0.75
409,R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3.0,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn’t even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it’s quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I’m considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can’t fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product’s popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. I’ll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,501,0.5

These headphones are, in fact, a cut above their competitors at cheaper levels. These things connect seamlessly with my Galaxy s23, and are pretty much rolling by the time you slide them in your ear. On that note, they do tend to wiggle out under any real activity (constantly adjust in the gym, definitely gonna fall out in SE Louisiana heat this time of year, luckily i could hear them when i put my ear to the grass to find them, so dont work outside with em.Overall i am impressed and kinda just kicking myself for not spending even more for a better fitting pair of buds.

411,R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4.0,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AE4SCIH4EIJQNY4BA7TKFA7WD6IQ,1,1,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,330,0.75

Although it had a charging cable, the length is very short. The sound quality is okay. The box included additional tip sizes for your ears. They are comfortable. These Beats Studio Buds were available at another retailer, but not in this red color. I was excited to be able to purchase this red for the same price here at Amazon. Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller. The small size of the case allows it to fit inside my jacket pocket, purse pocket, and pencil pouch. These buds have been paired with my android phone, Microsoft device, as well as the school apple device. These are not a 5, but overall, I like them.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AGK46PQHWEZH3E5FNLVSEMXYR6TA,1,2,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,187,0.75

415,RZSTHLOHCJIJV,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.,bigyuki555,4.0,"Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.I switched from AirPod Pro1 after nearly 5 years of daily use believing that the Beats are new and normally only about $75 less than the AirPod Pro so the quality should be pretty similar between 5-year-old AirPods and brand-new Beats, and according to the text descriptions they are...but there is a remarkable difference in performance on the transparency mode.To the point where just having the earbuds in your ears and nothing playing is not any better than just having old style earbuds/earplugs in your ears. Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb. If you are most interested in audio quality and noise cancellation, then the Beats will tick your boxes.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHPF7TUW7QLABIRVWV55ORHEXFXA,1,1,Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,191,0.75

446,R2FK2L6QM1M5F,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Loved ❤️; but wish a bit more ❤️‍🩹,Mr & Mrs,4.0,"Loved the ear buds. I use it mostly to listen to music and podcasts while I work on chores. Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on 😆.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,422,0.75
447,R7PJZSG0CG4IT,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Happy with these once I got a newer iPhone,Kindle Customer,5.0,"If I had paid full price for these I would have been more disappointed than I am. The sound quality is very good. I have an iPhone which is supposed to be ideal to use with these Beats but I have ongoing connectivity issues. I have some really cheap ear buds that as soon as I pick up the ear bud, it connects to my phone. These take longer and sometimes simply don’t connect at all. Then I have to put them back in their case and try again. I’m not sure if it is because my iPhone is an older model, but that shouldn’t matter as far as I know. For an Apple product, their quality falls short. I wouldn’t recommend these. I have had better experiences with Taotronics brand. These Beats were on sale and I thought I’d treat myself to something more upscale. I won’t do that again.UPDATE: I recently got a newer iPhone and wanted to edit my original review. Since I got the newer phone, I have had NO issues with the earbuds connecting to my phone. They connect seamlessly just as I hoped they would.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AFWQT73EO2KJQIYM7TLI7VWQXCSA,1,0,Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,191,1.0

Not only does the volume not go up loud enough but there is no bass. With my bose in ear headphones they had bass and almost enough volume. I went with these because my bose did not have the battery longevity that I needed. Also the beats don't feel secure in the ear. The bose are heavier but are definitely secure. The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around. I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast. I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good. Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set. Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks.

456,RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4.0,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,1,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,422,0.75
457,RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5.0,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,1,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,497,1.0

I really want them in red but they don’t make the Fit Pros in red so I tried these Studio ones thinking “surely they won’t be THAT different than the Fit Pros”. *sigh* They are. They are so sooooo different. Once you listen to your music using the Fit Pros….hearing every bass line…every instrument….and then pop in these Studio ones….your ears will start crying. Everything sounds low and cheap with the Studio Beats.-They fit in my ears like they want to jump out. The Fit Pros have that little “hook” thing that hugs that hump inside of your ear and they feel like they’ll stay in even during an earthquake. The Studio ones feel as though they will fall out if a butterfly whispers in my ear.-They won’t stay connected to my devices (Apple products).I just started the return process and will use this money and add some to it so that I can purchase another pair of the Fit Pros (maybe the blue pair).So…trust me….skip the Studio Beats and buy a pair of Fit Pros.

474,R2J7QWXMNJ99A7,B096SV8SJG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Slippery design, battery and other issues!",Amazon Customer,3.0,"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGNI36H7MMREKIH6HPQHV2CGG7BA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,185,0.5

Down side to these are the transparency and noise canceling features suck. The features aren’t really necessary since the headphones themselves block out noise very well. You’ll hear just a bunch of interference when either of those modes are on. Connection issues at times. It only happens when I first put the headphones on. They seem to want to disconnect but after a while they continue to play music fine with no issues.

I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to music—also fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped out—into a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 15–30 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with. Since I know that, I wait to do the dishes when I'm off the phone.

The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren’t too compatible with Siri. I’m a delivery driver so I can’t always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won’t read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn’t always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That’s the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they’re decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don’t fit right.Another thing I might add is that they’re a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they’re worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would’ve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it’s nice that the case charges them. There’s also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it. On the case itself it only has a small light that turns red when low.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023",AFFMX6QW56DDKHV6PJ4JGPCEPVNA,1,21,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,343,0.75

Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn’t do any good when their charging box is hours away and you’re out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that don’t sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable.

They have multidevice pairing and single earbud use, which were the main things I was looking for.Comfort: The stock plugs were kind of painful, but luckily this came with both larger and smaller plugs. The smaller set fit great in my ears, without ever falling out. I can wear them for about 2 hours and feel comfortable the whole time.Battery: Battery life is very, very good. I don't know the upper limit because I've never hit it. So far both the buds and the charging case hold charge very well.Audio: The audio on these is solid. Not mind-blowing, I've certainly heard better, but solid. Like a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. I am not an audiophile so this is more than ""good enough"" for me to use for music and phone calls. If you are an audiophile who needs the perfect crystal sound, you should probably look elsewhere.Form factor: They feel and look good in my ears, though like some reviews say, they are a little slippery. The round small shape and texture make it easy to drop them while putting them in or out. Likewise, the case can close easily, just as you balance to put buds away. Just be careful when doing so.Pairing: These were very easy to pair, and they pair and turn on INSTANTLY when you remove one or both from the case. It's mildly longer to switch if you have them paired to 2 devices, but that's kind of expected.App: The app that comes with these is really barebones and serves no purpose after initial setup. Just use it to set up your preferences, then you'll never need it again.Noise cancellation: I thought this was a gimmick, but it's actually very helpful. You can cycle between full noise cancellation, none, and pass-through. Personally I found pass-through to be unnecessary, with just on and off for NC to be enough. The Noise Cancellation can't cancel out EVERYTHING, but I used it during yard work and it cut the sound of a leafblower down by at least 65%. So it won't block everything, but definitely helps a lot in noisy environments. Similarly at the gym I felt with NC on, I really only heard the music and my own breathing, very little distracting other sounds. Do not use this while driving or crossing streets... it wouldn't be safe.Overall, for the price these are MUCH better than I hoped. Have to be one of the best purchases I've made in a while.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AG474R4F2TZG4EDS3Z5WNBFJZYYQ,1,21,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,435,1.0

I just wanted a cheaper pair while I decided about getting the new Jabra 10s.The sound quality on these is as good as the Elite 7s but there is a definite difference in comfort. These are bulkier and heavier in my ear and they don't stay in as well as the other pairs.I mostly listen to podcasts and pop music, so the fact that these are low bass is plus. I generally don't use ANC, but let's face it, no one buys Jabras if ANC is a priority.It usees the same Jabra app as the other headphones. That app is a huge selling point for Jabras in general. I love being able to change the sound profile and the white noise feature has gotten me through many an hour in a shared office.So, sound quality and Jabra app is worth the $50 I paid, but I couldn't wear them more than a couple of hours.

590,R2L1ANZVDHD204,B0BTZKP1TP,"4.0 out of 5 stars very comfortable, has most of the features found in more expensive earbuds",Win,4.0,"Jabra may not be considered a top brand for tws like Sony or Bose. They weren't known for highest audio quality like Technics or Sennheiser. However, when it comes to comfort, Jabra is second to none. I bought this pair because it's cheap and very comfortable.The Elite 4 has almost everything I was looking for even though it's not the best in any of those categories. First, it feels very comfortable the same way my Elite 7 does. Second, it has ANC and imo, better than the Elite 7. I haven't had a chance to try Elite 10 to compare yet so hopefully the 10 would do better but then again, it's 3 times the price of the 4 so I can't complain. ANC has never been a strong point for Jabra's products anyway but at least it still cut down some noise when I'm in the open.Hearthrough, however, is the best compare to all the other tws that I tried over the years. I remember Jabra was one of the first company came out with the idea to use microphones to allow users to hear the surrounding. My ancient 65t has this feature and that was so many years ago. I think this is one of the best quality in Jabra's tws and this pair still live up to that. Unfortunately, I can't control the level of hearthrough like my other Jabras so that's a bummer but at least it has that feature.The Elite 4 can be used either left or right by itself. What I like about it is it supports a real mono mode. Believe it or not, I have a few, more expensive, high end brands that doesn't support a true mono. When you use the right, you don't get the sound from left channel and vise versa. The Elite 4 combines both left and right so it's perfect for use as a mono.Multipoint is another feature I've seen in Jabra tws since 65t. This one has it too while, again, many expensive pairs don't support it. I have 2 phones so this is a deal breaker for me and Elite 4 delivered.Now, let's talk about some cons. First, this pair is slow to connect. Compare to other tws that will connect instantly after I took them out of the case. The Elite 4 took at least 2-3 seconds. Annoying, yes but I'm use to it now.Another thing I don't like is I can't change anything on the app the way I did with my other Jabras. Can't even customize the control. Luckily, at least they allow you to adjust the eq.So, my conclusion is if you're looking a working pair of tws that has all the features found in top brands. The Elite 4 has about 80% of it without breaking the bank. Just don't expect some fancy things like high res, top tier ANC or million ways of customization. The pair still work really well enough to be a daily driver. It has good microphones even though there're only 4 rather than 6 but I've never get a complain. Very compact and super comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AGOA6VPNL3A4APRLVEK2AV2RZ6HQ,0,0,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,520,0.75

599,R3BTKZXBVLBBUE,B0BTZKP1TP,4.0 out of 5 stars Work well.,Ivan Perez,4.0,"These headphones work really well. I’m going to compare the to the 1st Gen AirPods as that’s what I have to show what I like and don’t like.First off, you need to download the app to pair to your device. Annoying but whatever. After you make the settings to your liking you don’t have to use it again, the headphones just pair.What I like about them is that each side has a button that has its own dedicated functions depending on how many times or how long you press it. And you feel the click feedback. You can adjust the volume which you cannot do with the AirPods I have.The headphones also have very nice Noise Canceling in them. You can set it for sound to Passthrough but even then it’s low and muffled compared to the AirPods. I use my headphones at work and because I drive for a living I so NOT like the noise canceling since I need to hear around me driving in busy NYC. Even with the sound passthrough it’s not enough. I have to take them out. That’s most likely because of the silicon tips that the regular AirPods don’t have.Speaking of, I’m not a fan of the tips. But that’s just a personal presence. That’s one thing I love about the AirPods. They don’t have tips, and they are comfy and do not fall out most importantly.One thing about the AirPods is the mics LOVE to just stop working. I’ll be outside with them in and still holding the phone to my face because the caller can’t hear me. Mad annoying with no clear solution for it. I’ve tried them all it doesn’t work. They work when they damn well please. I didn’t have this issue with this set. tThey worked every time. Granted not enough time has passed to see if they stop functioning like the AirPod ones but so far so good. You can hear clearly and you can be heard clearly.They work like any other BT headphones. The case charges them. You charge the case with a USB-C cable. I don’t think it has wireless charging but that’s fine. The battery life I’m not even sure what it is. I was never concerned for it. Or had them die. To be fair I don’t leave em in as long as AirPods because as I stated earlier I need to hear and I feel like they impede that for me so I remove them.I do recommend these for people who use public transportation which is why I gave them to my fiancé. The noise canceling works great. If you don’t need to listen to your surroundings, I recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2023",AHLSHNLUSQX2V4FNBKAK3DIWXIFA,0,2,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,449,0.75
600,R1JBQTP05FUBYC,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price,DocBrown,5.0,"I’ve been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought I’d try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The “Quick setup guide” was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone. Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. I’m in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyone’s ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds. I can’t comment on failed bub issues yet, it’s too early, so we’ll see.I didn’t intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFWLU4KB7AN2ZGSOS3HICOKC44SQ,1,26,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,497,1.0
601,R1YXPTOD9CWT3I,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound at a good price,Ben W.,5.0,"I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didn’t want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasn’t really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. I’ll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I don’t think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only “issue” I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. It’s a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. I’ve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds I’ve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like it’s naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. It’s really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and it’s nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2021",AE7GOV7WYUWHSSVCGB5SQSMJI34Q,1,76,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,555,1.0
602,R19VWKTRIXU414,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice for ear buds,Crotorious,4.0,"I've used these ear buds for almost 2 years and strongly considered re-buying them once I started facing issues. When it comes to sound quality, they're good, and the latency is small, but you'll notice it's there. The best part of these ear buds has to be the battery life; these things last all day, and can be fully charged back up twice with the case. Though if you're looking for something with strong noise cancellation, you might want to consider looking for a different pair of ear buds, as these are really only capable of blocking out most speech. Overall, they're a pretty good pair of ear buds, but I do have a few problems with them.First, when they get to low battery, the text to speech voice will say ""Recharge headset"" just frequently enough to become mildly vexing. This is my primary complaint about these ear buds.Now mind you, I haven't treated these ear buds very well, they went through constant abuse and were used in sub-optimal environments the entire time I've owned them. The next two complaints are likely a result of my poor treatment of these.Second, after about two years of use, their connectivity isn't as great anymore; the range in which I can use these has dropped considerably. I used to be able to walk in my backyard without issues, but now I can barely leave the room without the connection dropping constantly.Lastly, the left earbud has recently developed a problem with connecting to the case; it seems the leads just don't connect half the time. This occasionally causes small inconveniences with the left ear bud turning on in the case and randomly hijacking the audio output of my pc, or it just doesn't end up charging and I'm stuck with a single ear bud until I manage to get it to charge again.Overall, this is a pretty good product. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a pair of long-lasting wireless earbuds and doesn't need the best sound quality or noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2023",AFRT3UTZANKCA7EGGKYQAVIXOJ5Q,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,338,0.75
603,RB0NQXL4O1IZ,B08ZR5JB9G,1.0 out of 5 stars Only really lasted 8 months,Jake Boop,1.0,"Edit: originally rated 1 star as the earbuds that I received were open-box/used. I don’t think it’s fair to Sennheiser that my 1 star rating remains on here because that was a fault of Amazon. These earbuds sound great. Absolutely great. The connection seems to be good so far as well (I’ve seen a lot of negative reviews saying otherwise). They are very comfortable for my ears, I’m a Tool Maker/machinist and wear an earbud in one ear I all day and other earbuds that I’ve tried get uncomfortable or start to fall out but I have had no issues with fit at all. As far as the features on the app: the equalization is only a 3-band eq which is a shame, I’d much rather at least a 5 or 7-band eq but it’s better than nothing for sure. The side tone feature is supposed to use the mic to feed into the speaker, allowing you to hear outside talking, but it doesn’t seem to really work at all. I haven’t tested a phone call using them yet so maybe my mic is defective but I really wouldn’t care because I don’t need it. Overall this is a great pair of earbuds for the price.Original review: This item came in with the packaging already opened with another piece of tape over the original seal. The earbuds were covered in earwax and ear hair. Disgusting. If I wanted to buy an “open box/used” I would’ve selected that option instead of paying full price for it.Edit 3/14/2023: it's been 8 months and the connectivity issues have been becoming a decent problem. I take them out of the case and they won't connect, so I put them back it and take them out again and usually they'll connect after the second try. But lately I've been having to re-pair them to my phone. I'll take them out of the case and instead of the usual ""power on..... connected"" notification, it's just silence. And it's not as simple as just re-pairing them because they won't go into pairing mode unless I reset them. The battery life is also taking a dive.I started out really loving these, now I've been very disappointed because they're just such a hassle to deal with. With all of this, especially only being 8 months of use, I'm going to have to update my review from 5 stars to 2.Edit 7/17/2023: the right earbud just stopped working all together, it'll power on but refuses to connect to BluetoothEdit 1/24/2024: I've been trying to get as much use out of these just to justify the amount I spent on them before I replace them but all it has really given me is issues with connectivity and reliability. I expect any earbuds at this price range to last years, I should have no problem getting the same life out of earbuds that you would expect from a phone. I wish I would've just either returned them or thrown them away a long time ago. I'm going to start looking into replacements now. Adjusting my 2 star rating to a 1 star.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AE2R5XX5O7LVG57B7S2L22VH2QIA,1,10,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,520,0.0
604,R32H19VXW9WGNF,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison with Momentum TW,Steve Kranyec,5.0,"I have a pair of CX's that are about 1.5 years old, and another set that I just recently purchased. In the middle, I have a pair of Momentum TW 3's that are ~6 months old. The TLDR here is that instead of repurchasing the Momentum, I got another pair of the CX's.I'm not an audiophile, and I mostly listen to audiobooks and make calls with earbuds, so I'm not going to be speaking to audio quality at all. For me, it's fine.My six month old Momentum's have a dead left earbud. Possibly this is anecdotal, but if anything I was more gentle with the Momentum's than the CX's, and the CX's have lasted three times as long. Yes, I drop them. Yes, the dead left Momentum died after the most recent drop. I'm not saying that earbuds should survive infinite drops, but in my experience, the CX's are more durable.I did really really like the ANC on the Momentum's. It killed the battery life, but when you need ANC, it was great to have. The pass-through audio was also awesome. It was almost like having a mini-hearing-aide.The CX's have been substantially less finicky than the Momentum. They connect quicker, I've had to reset them fewer times, and they seem to have better range.Between the (substantial) difference in price and the areas where the CX's are superior, I my opinion, the CX's are the better option. If dropping $150 every six months on earbuds is within your budget, I fully endorse the Momentums. For me, I need to have two working sets around at any given time as I wear them a substantial amount of my waking hours, so I'd rather swap to an overear model when I need ANC and go with the cheaper and more durable option.Quick recommendation -- splurge on the foam eartips. If you're like me and wear earbuds an unhealthy amount of time, they're substantially more comfortable. They do wear out, and they're not cheap, but the added comfort for long-wears is huge.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AGW3GZDQI7IIZB7FOD2IAOKUKMGA,1,8,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,338,1.0
605,R2M4WDO3B23EX,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, Horrible mic for calls",billyillyilly,3.0,"The good, these ear buds have a decent battery life, sit well in the ear without falling out (held with just the rubber insert), have good (not great) sound quality. A perfect example of the sound is with FFDP ""A little bit off"" which has extremely clean sound on a quality system. These ear buds lack the clean treble when the high hat hits and the deep tones of the bass. If you just want sound without worrying being an audiophile they're good.The bad, no noise cancelling... at all! During phone calls the mic is good in a quiet place. if there is ANY background noise, they will pick up that noise over your voice. I tried them multiple times in different cars and no matter the amount of road noise it drowned out my voice making conversations almost impossible unless I yelled. In an office environment the sound of the keyboard while typing would make conversation hard to understand for whoever was sorry enough to be on the other end of the call.I've been a Sennheiser fan for a long time and have had many of their headphones (still use some old wired buds CX100II for listening to music at work and love them), these are the first that I am returning due to be unusable for conversation.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2024",AHYASE5EWU5VJUIBY7QPUY6JS6FA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,219,0.5
606,R1DTEWZS5AYFKH,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Not quite what I expected,Michal D. Wisteria,2.0,"So I'll start with the positive. The headphones are comfortable, the sound is great, and the battery life is pretty good too (supposed to be 9.5 hours, I got around 7). The bass felt great, skipping songs was a breeze, and the sound quality when answering calls on them was decent as well.The less great parts. After 6 1/2 hours or so, one headphone would die, usually the left one. Then the right would reconnect, and I could keep listening to things for a bit longer. But the biggest reason for the 2 star review is that my right earbud broke after about 11 months. I took good care of these headphones; they were usually in their case or in my ear. Last week I noticed the right earbud had no sound. I thought I just had to restart them and reconnect, but after a few tries of that I heard just hints of sound for half a second when moving the earbud in the ear, so I knew the audio wasn't working. But all the other features were. I could still pause, skip songs, etc with the right or left earbud. I went on my order page on Amazon and found the support section. There was a link to a product support site for Sannheiser... It was 404, page not found. There was a phone number too.... It was disconnected apparently. So now I have just a left side, good-sounding earbud.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2022",AEKYYYRFAHIBUCQXZMRBNGIQET3A,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,242,0.25

609,R30839P76Q86K9,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, good physical construction outside. Elsewhere, not so much",Ben,3.0,"I've owned a few pairs of earbuds, all wired. I prefer over-ear headphones, but needed something small, portable and more discreet for work.These looked decent and my past experiences with Sennheiser sound quality also helped make my decision at the time.Sound quality is excellent, overall noise isolation is pretty good for no ANC, bass mids and highs are all present and clear. I do own several pairs of studio/reference headphones, which these obviously don't compare to, but they do manage to make a good account of themselves. Battery lifespan is excellent too and despite no wireless charging (not that it was a deal breaker in my case) the case charged very quickly. Just would have been nice if the charging cable was longer than the dinky one supplied.I used the smallest set of ear cushions, these are decently comfortable for up to a couple hours but do start to press against my ears for longer periods.Construction quality of the case and buds is decent, not too heavy but not feather light either. It's a shame that doesn't go into the internal electronics.First off, the Bluetooth connectivity is not a win. These would repeatedly disconnect themselves when bringing them out of ""sleep"" always one or the other bud. The Sennheiser Smart Control App does allow customization of the buds controls and a graphic equalizer. But it would keep proclaiming it needed a update, even though it was the most up-to-date version.Now these, when they paired, sounded great. After using these for nearly a year, the right bud suddenly had an internal fault and produced flakey, weak sound. That was not a Bluetooth issue, but rather the hardware either failing on a circuit level or a wire becoming loose due to a cold solder joint. I've owned plenty of headphones that are more cheaply made than these with worse sound quality but still function as intended.Looking up this problem seems to be inherit with the CX True Wireless, with complaints occuring anywhere from a few months of ownership to nearly a year or more. Replacements from Sennheiser have been described as having a repeat issue after a similar period of time, or are merely DOA.Shame, this isn't the Sennheiser I knew. Time for a different pair from a different manufacturer.

I bought a pair of name brand earbuds that was on sale during BF. Long story short, I had to return it because the sound quality was unacceptable.Rather than trying to find a diamond in haystack so to speak, I picked Sennheiser as it is a brand that I have good experience with. Furthermore, I opted for a higher price point than the rock bottom price I was hoping for.I forgo noise cancelling since I don't need it most of the time. Sonically, this pair of earbuds is very good, bearing typical Sennheiser sound of open and balance. It is still no match for my over the ear headphones, but it is also significantly cheaper. Sound quality is by far the most important aspect, other features are distant seconds and thirds.BT connectivity is, however, not Sennheiser's strength. It took some work to get it connected to all of my devices; I have a pair of Sennheiser over the ear BT headphone that behaves similarly. All of my cheaper BT earbuds have no BT connectivity issues.

I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser of course.

I’m an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.Now yes these are 100% plastic but they don’t feel cheap and that plastic also means they don’t feel cold touching your skinYes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause I’ve had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.No wireless charging but who cares it’s USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work dayAnd the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but that’s inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.Could you get better sound sure but why it’s Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better soundIf you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then you’ll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones you’ll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2021",AFV7ZI225WCIGLKBRRZGPKITFUKQ,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,389,0.75

I'm hearing details in songs I never heard before, it honestly made me tear up. Incredibly clarity, customizable EQ, AMAZING sound for 100$. You could easily get something with comparable sound that costs twice as much. The sound is why I bought these. Sennheiser is a sound-focused brand. However, there are some places where these headphones cut corners that would not be a problem if you bought 200$+ dollar headphones.Security: I'm a dancer, and I want my headphones to stay on while I'm working in the studio. However, the earbuds aren't the most secure in my ears. They fly out during chainée turns, sometimes even just as I'm walking they'll fall out.Comfort: Not the most comfortable for hours of listening. After 2-3 hours of extended use, my ears ached. Changing up the plastic tips didn't help.Noise cancelling: I heard the ANC takes the edge off the sound quality, which is why I bought these and not the active noise cancelling ones. You can definitely tell. I can hear each step I take as I walk thudding in my ears. It's a little odd.Delay: I've tried to use these to watch tiktoks on my phone, and I've noticed a delay in the screen and the sound. I can see the person on my screen moving their mouth, but the words come out into my headphones a little later. It's not the worst, but it's noticeable.Overall: Great for audiophiles on a budget. The app allows you to customize, so there's something to love for everyone, whether you love a sparkling, bright treble or you're a total basshead. For sitting down and listening while you're at your computer, these are an excellent choice. If you're mainly wearing these for working out, maybe something else would suit your needs better. I do equal parts both, which is why I like these a lot. mp3 files can massacre the music quality, and bad headphones can make the sound even muddier. These are an excellent buy.

Having owned multiple headphones/earphones over the years this is product is in-line with Sennheiser – great sound quality for the price (they lowered it), but you pay with electronics/wiring issues. This maybe the last Sennheiser product I get for a while, but not in a good way…Goal: Portable “do everything” earphones with good sound quality. I wanted to be able use them around the home: smartphone music, binging Netflix, work computer for Zoom calls, etc. I’d been using whatever generic thing $40 could get; this time I decided to splurge past $100 (purchased at was $130 w/ points).Pros:• Sound quality. I’m not an audiophile, but I’ve owned 10+ headphones/earphones, different brands. The sound is lively, bass is strong without being overwhelming.• Case – form factor is great!

Could probably use it 2-3 days of regular use before getting a warning.• Mic works – gets the job done.• Sennheiser app – you can change what device it connects to and adjust EQ settings.Cons:• Connectivity: atrocious. I’ve had to soft reset / hard reset this too many times. Bluetooth isn’t a new technology. This should be “set it and forget it.” * About 5% of the time, only 1 earphone connects. Disconnecting and reconnecting doesn’t do anything and I have to do a soft reset. * When using the app, it sometimes refuses to disconnect from the current device so I can connect to what the device I want.

And I love that there is an equalizer in the app so you can adjust it to sound the way you want it. They offer a lot of cool features that apparently not all earbuds have. You can change what the different taps do, but they are capable of answering your phone, raising and lowering the volume, fast forwarding, rewinding, or skipping tracks of songs, pausing and playing - all just buy tapping on the earbuds. Even though it is not one of their advertised features, they also do a very good job of noise canceling as long as they fit in your ear properly.So here's the downside that I found... These earbuds are large and square. Most ears are pretty round. I realize that all ears are shaped differently, but I have a hard time believing that these fit comfortably in most ears. If you're just sitting still at your desk or in the car, it's not too bad. But if you smile really big, they come loose, and If you lean over, they fall out of your ear entirely. When the Stem is seated properly in your ear, The big square part rubs uncomfortably against the outer ear. For this reason alone I am debating whether to return these, or Just suffer with it since I mostly use them in the car or at work. These could be great earbuds if they were more organomically designed.One last note - I don't have a lot to compare it to. But they advertise that the battery life is superior on these, and i'm not convinced. Now I admit I had them running for most of an 8 hour workday. But I had to switch between the left ear and the right ear while one of them was charging in the case, i'd use the other one.

They’re not super bassy like the Beats and Raycons I’ve had, which in some ways are better. I think a lot of people’s problems with these is that they aren’t proper Audiophile material like some of Sennheiser’s other products, but if you’re looking for wireless buds, you probably aren’t really looking for the greatest sound on the market.I like the software that these use.

It also lets you switch between sources more easily than some other Bluetooth headphones.I will say that these aren’t the most ergonomic earbuds ever, they fit just fine normally, but if you try to sleep with them, or put any pressure on your ear with a hat or something, they really dig into your ears, but that’s a non issue to most people.The noise cancellation is decent, but I’m pretty sure there’s not any tech behind it like with the AirPods, I think these just plug up your ears so you don’t hear the outside noise, and they do that pretty well.The case is pretty good too. It’s a bit thicker than the AirPods case, but it’s not as huge as some others, feels high quality, and holds a charge very well.","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022",AGRH7XGXKLIEPMBBM2ACI6JYH3DA,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,277,0.75
618,R2QXYFBQLOZ7HI,B08ZR5JB9G,3.0 out of 5 stars Not worth the hassle,Kl,3.0,"The headphone’s sound great. They fit well and comfy. But the hassle of figuring out how to charge these things properly is awful. Most the time getting them to sit right in order to charge is a chore…a real chore. If you can finally get them to set and charge then great but if not you have to deal with the battery life (27 hours is a lie). Not at all a great price, don’t understand how people can say its great value when they don’t work properly half the time wether it be charging pr pairing issues. Senheiser is being lazy with the earbud route.","Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2024",AG4SLCKABAGKL3N4ZPN4XMOKKDZA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,106,0.5
619,R2DX8KHP8703FK,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars This one doesn't live up to the Sennheiser name,Nicky,2.0,"I had a Sennheiser full over-the-ear headphones some years ago and was satisfied with it. I bought this one on Black Friday and have been using it for several days. I now have three pairs of earbuds: Apple AirPods, SkullCandy and this one, which took me the most time to pair and connect.1) The small paper guide conveniently didn't mention that a small film on the mental contact must be peeled off. The charging case showed green light after a couple hours charging but I couldn't get them to connect. It was only after researching the questions section that I learned about this step (so apparently others were confused too).2) The shape of the earbuds make it difficult to grab and pull them out of the charging case. Each time it takes more than one try.3) No indicator light on the front of earbuds themselves to show the battery level. My SkullCandy (much cheaper but equally good sound quality) has indicator light on the earbuds. It would become red to tell me to put it back in the charging case.4) To connect to a device for the first time is confusing. A YouTube clip tells me to watch the little light in the back to blink red/blue to indicate it's ready to pair/connect. But when I tried to connect with a second device (after disconnecting from the first one), it didn't blink. The guide shows to put fingers on the earbuds (after inserting into the ears) to put it in paring mode. The SkullCandy doesn't require any additional step: after the earbuds are taken out of the case, a voice tells you that it's ready to connect.5) It won't let you switch from one device to another easily. When I turn off the Bluetooth on my iPad and tried to switch to my cellphone (with earbuds still in my ears), I can't connect right away. I wound up having to put them back in the case and then take them out to connect to the second device (unlike SkullCandy, which stays in pairing mode and lets you connect to the 2nd device right away).All in all, It's not worth the value compared to a cheaper but better product like SkullCandy.Added 12/27/2022: Now that I’ve used for more than three weeks (bought on Black Friday), I should downgrade the rating from my initial 3 stars to 2 stars. I finally managed to connect it with my laptop after several attempts but it seemed random and I still don’t know how it happened. And it happened several times that one of the earbuds would lose sound for no apparent reason while I was using them. I would need to take them out of my ears, put them back into the case, took them out to reconnect again. Or sometimes only one earbud got connected with the device after taking both out of the charging case. I would not buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2022",AGUCYTK4WI5QN4KWJ7K43QZ6LSKQ,1,5,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,489,0.25
620,R3A7SZWF07Q649,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Superb for old or poor quality audio of movies and Youtubes,Geoffrey N.,4.0,"This was my first pair of Bluetooth buds ever so I had to really study the online information & reviews. I use these for content consumption at home so don't need all options available like sport buds, remote charging, outdoor or loud environment noise cancelling, etc. Those features cost extra money so I got a great price on these for exactly what my needs are. When they were brand new on the market they cost a lot more. A lot of news channel interviews are with guests not in the studio. They're at their home or office so the sound is of poor quality. I listen to a lot of news in Spanish so with the other factors mentioned it's hard for me to understand. Sometimes there will even be a music overlay which really makes it hard for me to understand. These Sennheisers clean it all up. Just beautiful.Amazon shipped 'em to me in South America right to my door with no problem whatsoever.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2023",AG4X5EGQM4ARYEQN5PWBPLWF2BLA,1,1,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,165,0.75
