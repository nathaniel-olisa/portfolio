# ðŸŽ§ Beats by Dre â€“ Wireless Speaker Consumer Insights (Externship)

**Role:** Data Analytics Extern | **Focus:** Survey + Amazon reviews â†’ sentiment, EDA, strategy

---

## Executive Summary
Customers love **sound quality** and **value**; friction clusters around **battery life**, **connectivity**, and **durability**. Recommend an entry product at **$79â€“$99** and a core model at **$149â€“$179**, with marketing that leads on **sound + battery** and channels that prioritize **Amazon**.

---

## Data & Methods
- **Data:** Survey (n=20), Amazon reviews (thousands)  
- **Repo note:** To keep this repo lightweight, I included **sample subsets** of the large review datasets (`part01` only). The full datasets were used for analysis and are available upon request.
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, nltk, TextBlob), Matplotlib/Seaborn, React/TS for dashboard  
- **Tasks:** Cleaning, EDA, sentiment scoring (VADER/TextBlob), comparative analysis, storytelling
