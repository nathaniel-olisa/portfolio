Even without music playing, it's hard to hear people talking to you when both are in.-The transparency mode is great. Still gives you solid sound quality but it's not putting you in a sound proof box.-Battery life isn't anything special in comparison to any other set of headphones I've ever owned. They last most of the work day (8 hours) though, so it's not as if it's terrible. If you listen to the volume super low, you'll get another hour or two out of them.-These are super customizable. You can boost bass and all that jazz. Sound quality I'd give a 4/5. They're not THE BEST but they are way above other brands.-The google assistant is nice. It makes a soft beep when a notification pops up, and will read the texts to you. In general, all notifications are a soft sound. When the battery is dying it gives soft little bloops, even if the volume had been up high.-I love the fact it gives you individual battery levels. Each ear bud will have it's own battery percentage on your phone so if you start out with one and pick up the other, you'll know where you're at with each PRIOR to them dying.-Another feature I love love love.... if you take an earbud out, it'll pause your music for you. This extends to movies as well. So if you get interrupted, you won't miss out on anything. Once you put it back in it'll resume playing automatically.-Comfortable fit. It comes with multiple ear tips, but the ones that came on them fit well. No matter what, my ears have always gotten an uncomfortable feeling after wearing them for awhile, but I can go the entire day with these in and it doesn't hurt. Sometimes I actually forget I have them in. They're also movement proof. I've yet to have one fall out of my ear, or even shift while bending, lifting, anything.TDLR; battery life is pretty good, but not magnificent. These are beyond comfortable. The noise cancellation will make you feel like you're in a silence booth.\",\n          \"I like these. never even know they are in your ears. very comfortable. I had one earbud that would keep disconnecting and had no sounds. I called bose and they had me put them back in the case to reset them. it kept fixing it but then the earbud would lose sound again. customer service was not helpful. I returned them and ordered a new pair, hoping I will not have the same problem.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 924,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2023\",\n          \"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2022\",\n          \"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"profile_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4708,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"AFTYR45ZXE6MP6TLETOZ7NUCWC6Q\",\n          \"AG755GISXW5R2XKBQFHGDRFTH6NQ\",\n          \"AHG7ZFOQ4ISFZW72BZJDVISE35KQ\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_verified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 61,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2284,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 117,\n        \"samples\": [\n          327,\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_attributes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 135,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Color: Black/GoldStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+\",\n          \"Color: ChestnutStyle: Bluetooth speaker\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 149,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 2172,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 541,\n        \"samples\": [\n          280,\n          48\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"normalized_rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.26608516776437224,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.75,\n          0.25\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The flat shape, the small size, the selection of noise-blocking ambient sounds included in the app, even a sleep timer\\u2026while you certainly CAN use them as everyday buds (and if you have very small ears, you might want to) these are clearly intended for being comfortable enough to wear at night and block out unwanted noises. I love them for that. I previously hated wearing noise-cancelling earbuds at night, which was somewhat of a necessity to me due to my wife\\u2019s snoring problem; with these buds, I ditched the discomfort and pain and accidental button triggering in favor of a much more comfortable experience, to the point where I actually enjoyed putting them in every night. They\\u2019re not called the \\u201cComfoBuds\\u201d for nothing.The ANC is not the best I\\u2019ve ever tried, but gets the job done as far as helping to seal out those pesky nighttime disruptions. Sound quality is admittedly not the greatest. Don\\u2019t get me wrong, it\\u2019s perfectly acceptable, it just suffers in a few areas that probably directly relate to the size of the buds. Soundstage is poor, instrument separation is very poor, and the volume tends to skew on the quiet side, but if you\\u2019re using these for sleep, none of that matters too much.Now here comes the real caveat.1MORE is clearly having a serious quality control issue with the ComfoBuds mini. I can\\u2019t say for certain whether this extends to their other models, as this is the only product of theirs I\\u2019ve tried. And while the idea is fantastic and they\\u2019ve clearly put a lot of effort into the design of these buds, there\\u2019s a persistent issue with one or both earbuds suddenly losing its noise-cancelling ability after a very short period of time, producing whooshing or roaring noises instead of blocking sound.\\u201cIt\\u2019s just earwax blocking up the buds!\\u201d insist the apologist reviewers, as well as 1MORE themselves. \\u201cClean them and they\\u2019ll be fine!\\u201d But I beg to differ. With my first pair of these, the whooshing started in the right earbud after about two months of use. I immediately followed every bit of advice I could find about cleaning them, to no avail. I thought, okay, that\\u2019s a bummer, and I sent them back and ordered another pair. The left earbud of the second pair started whooshing within two weeks. I repeat: TWO WEEKS. I had used them less than ten times since I got them, plus I was being very careful about cleaning my ears every day, so there is NO WAY that they accumulated enough earwax during that time to block them up. Something else is going on. I wonder if trying to cram so much tech into such a small package is backfiring, and the components are interfering with each other somehow. Maybe that\\u2019s why you don\\u2019t normally see ANC in buds of this size.1MORE will replace malfunctioning buds for you, but the process does take a while, and you\\u2019ll be without them in the meantime. It seems they\\u2019re aware of the issue, which is good. I really hope that they\\u2019ll figure out what\\u2019s wrong and release a second version of the ComfoBuds Mini that doesn\\u2019t have these problems.I should probably take off more than one star for the quality control issue\\u2026but I just can\\u2019t bring myself to. Because when these buds are working, they\\u2019re really the perfect sleep buds, and I just can\\u2019t see myself ditching them; nothing blocks out my wife\\u2019s snoring more comfortably than these. I only hope that they\\u2019ll continue to improve in the future. In the meantime, it\\u2019s up to you to decide if the risks outweigh the benefits.\",\n          \"So out of the box these tiny buds surprised me. The fit was amazing for me considering I\\u2019m one of those with extremely tiny ears. The sound was okay but after setting up soundid they sounded pretty good with nice bass and clarity. Now on to the bad.ANC.. was alright then I started noticing the left bud wouldn\\u2019t function like the right one. A day later whenever anc was enabled the left bud would vibrate and distort sound. Tried resetting and all of that but it\\u2019s clearly a hardware issue as it now happens whenever I try to use them. These buds also lack a mono sound when only one is in use. I own many buds and I\\u2019ve never run into that before so when using one bud you\\u2019re missing out on a lot of tucked away frequencies. When anc was functioning properly it was eh at best. To me more sound was canceled out with all functions turned off. I\\u2019ve literally only had these for 3 days and they\\u2019re defective already which is a shame because I like the sound and how they fit. Transparency mode was a little much for me especially considering you can\\u2019t adjust the volume for it.Touch controls are hardly customizable, I\\u2019m not a fan of only having two tap and triple tap functions.Call quality was actually pretty bad. The person I was talking to would constantly drop out and sound like staticEDIT:Now both earbuds produce a loud buzzing sound whenever using anc/transparency mode. You can hear and feel it, the buds will actually vibrate a bit. They work fine with anc/transparency mode turned off. Would really like a replacement.\",\n          \"I needed a replacement for my Galaxy buds pro's that have the fatal ANC \\\"roar in one ear\\\" that Samsung won't fix, and they don't stay in the ear. Bring an absolutely ENORMOUS fan of the 1more comfobuds z (the single best sleep focused earbuds at any price) I liked that these are also small, the case shape is wonderful (flip top, tiny, wireless charger) and they're relatively inexpensive.The sound quality uses 1more's app to do a \\\"sounds\\\" hearing preference test. I would prefer a proper EQ option but it works well enough. I prefer real audiophile iem's and headphones, but enjoyed the Galaxy buds on bass boost, they almost hit like planar magnetics. These are about 80% there. They're totally serviceable, with the only standout being a pretty good technical performance, with genuinely solid imaging and separation. They absolutely do need the soundID set up though, I hate the stock tuning. For tiny little things they are, I am perfectly happy with the sound quality when I want music on my bike or public transit.The ANC is stellar. They have a specific mode for wind reduction that downright curbstomps Samsung and apple. If you ride a bike, you need 1more ANC buds. The transparency mode is great too, very natural sounding. It doesn't have that \\\"talk and it switches to transparency\\\" gimmick, but I found it obnoxious on Samsung.Touch controls are easily customized and no \\\"single touch\\\" feature means you don't accidentally press anything readjusting or putting them in. Auto pauses when you take one out, your can use just one or the other no problemThe app features depend on the product but these are meant to be usable for sleeping, do they come preloaded with a library of sleep/ambient sounds. I just use my own but it's a nice feature. I can easily fall asleep with them in and I'm a very picky side sleeper, but I do prefer the absolutely microscopic comfobuds z's.The stock eartips did bother me a bit, they have a little ridge from the mold that irritated my ears after a few hours of use. They have a very odd mounting system that I was only able to find one option for, spinfit 1025 tips are shallow enough to fit and still let the case close (the wells for the eartips is a bit to shallow, id like it if they addressed this on a revision) so if you don't like the tips, spinfit 1025's.The case magnets that hold the buds in are hilariously strong. Your have to SMACK it to dislodge them. Very nice detail. The case size is tiny and perfectly shaped to slide into pockets, with a flip top that you can open one handedFor being so small they also stay put well. Not perfect, but I can work out or mow the lawn, an impossible task of the Galaxy buds pro.Overall though, these things rock. They're exactly what I need as a paramedic who also rides a bicycle. 1more is a serious brand with some seriously well thought out products at extremely competitive prices. I can sleep on my side with a podcast and still be able to wake up for a call, they crush wind nose when I'm riding my bike, they sound perfectly adequately tuned with impressive imaging (once you run the sound id feature once) and the case is (slightly too shallow recessions for the eartips aside) very nice in the hand and perfectly shaped.Highly recommend.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.02986702406541747,\n        \"min\": 0.13538579964636302,\n        \"max\": 0.2086794019933554,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.13538579964636302,\n          0.2086794019933554,\n          0.1823373574782025\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The wind reduction mode also receives specific praise.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Sound Quality (after SoundID):** While the SoundID personalization feature is a point of contention (see below), many users report that *after* using SoundID (or employing third-party EQs), the sound quality is good, with praise for bass and clarity.  The \"out-of-the-box\" sound is often criticized, however.\n",

This issue, along with the difficulty in getting replacements, significantly impacts the user experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **SoundID and Lack of Manual EQ:** The SoundID sound personalization system is widely disliked. Users find it ineffective and prefer a traditional, manual equalizer for precise sound adjustments. The absence of a manual EQ is a major frustration for many.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Limited Touch Controls:**  The limited customization options for touch controls are another frequent complaint.

            "* **Durability/Reliability:** Some models suffered from recurring technical problems, including hums/clicks in one earbud, and charging issues.\n",

            "* **Ease of Use:**  Pairing and connection were generally described as easy and seamless, especially with Apple devices.\n",
            "* **Price (for some):**  Several reviewers felt the earbuds offered excellent value for their price, especially when purchased on sale.\n",

            "* **Noise Cancellation/Transparency:**  While noise cancellation was generally considered \"good\" or \"adequate,\" transparency mode was frequently criticized for being ineffective or poorly implemented.\n",
            "* **Microphone Quality:**  Several reviewers reported poor microphone quality, with callers struggling to hear them clearly, especially in windy conditions.\n",
            "* **Controls:**  The controls, while simple, were sometimes reported as overly sensitive, leading to accidental activation.\n",
            "* **Battery Life (for some):** While some praised the battery life, others reported it as shorter than advertised, particularly with features like transparency mode enabled.\n",

Sony's strengths lie in comfort and size, but sound quality and app experience need improvement, and reliability was an issue for some users. Beats generally pleased with sound quality but struggles with durability, fit consistency, and microphone quality for some.  The \"best\" brand depends heavily on individual priorities and preferences.  Reading more detailed reviews before purchasing is highly recommended.\n",

One user even mentions needing 8 hours for long flights, highlighting the inadequacy for extended use.  Several users experienced a significant decrease in battery life after a short period.\n",
