# üéß Beats by Dre ‚Äì Wireless Speaker Consumer Insights (Externship)

**Role:** Data Analytics Extern (Consumer Insights)  
**Scope:** Survey + Amazon review analysis ‚Üí sentiment, feature insights, competitive positioning ‚Üí business recommendations

---

## 1) Executive Summary

I analyzed consumer feedback from a cleaned wireless speaker **survey (20 responses)** and **thousands of Amazon reviews** to understand what drives satisfaction/dissatisfaction and where Beats can differentiate. The evidence points to strong enthusiasm for **sound quality** and **value**, with recurring friction around **battery life, connectivity, and durability**. I translated these findings into concrete product and go-to-market recommendations.

---

## 2) Business Context

The wireless speaker market is crowded (JBL, Bose, Sony, Anker). Beats has brand heat and design leadership, but consumers demand **capable + reliable** hardware at compelling price points. This project maps what customers actually say and how they behave‚Äîso product and marketing can act with confidence.

## 6) Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

I used **VADER** (categories) and **TextBlob** (polarity/subjectivity) to score review text.

**Common language across all reviews (what people actually talk about):**

**Most frequent words within 5-star reviews (what delights customers):**

**Sentiment category counts (positive dominates, but negatives flag real issues):**

## 8) What Customers Actually Say (Themes)

- **Loved:** sound quality, bass, easy setup, portability, brand experience.  
- **Pain points:** battery life (especially under heavy use), Bluetooth drop-offs, durability (scratches/knocks), perceived price/value gaps.  
- **Channel behavior:** shoppers gravitate to **Amazon** and price-transparent retailers; D2C needs stronger value incentives.

---

## 9) Recommendations

**Product**
- Prioritize **battery optimization** and **connection stability**; ruggedize the enclosure (drop/water resistance).
- Tiered lineup:
  - **Entry ($79‚Äì$99):** ‚Äúvalue-premium‚Äù play to win volume against JBL/Anker.
  - **Core ($149‚Äì$179):** long battery, strong bass, IP rating; flagship sound.
- Ship firmware telemetry to monitor connection/battery issues post-launch.

**Marketing**
- Lead with **sound quality + long battery**; position value clearly vs. JBL.
- Leverage **Amazon presence** (A+ content, video, reviews program); focus electronics retail for displays.
- Influencer/UGC emphasizing workouts, dorm/desk setups, and small-space sound.

**CX/Support**
- Proactive replacements for early defects; visible commitment to durability.
- Setup guides for Bluetooth reliability across OS/device versions.
