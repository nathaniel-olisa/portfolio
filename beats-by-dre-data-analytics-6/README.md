## 1) Executive Summary
I analyzed consumer feedback from a cleaned wireless speaker **survey (20 responses)** and **thousands of Amazon reviews** to understand what drives satisfaction/dissatisfaction and where Beats can differentiate. The evidence points to strong enthusiasm for **sound quality** and **value**, with recurring friction around **battery life, connectivity, and durability**. The findings below translate into concrete product and go-to-market recommendations.

## 5) Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

I used **VADER/TextBlob** to score review text (polarity & subjectivity) and categorize sentiment.  
**Common language across all reviews (what people actually talk about):**

**Sentiment category counts (positive dominates, but negatives flag real issues):**

## 7) What Customers Actually Say (Themes)

- **Loved:** sound quality, bass, easy setup, portability, brand experience.  
- **Pain points:** battery life (especially under heavy use), Bluetooth drop-offs, durability (scratches/knocks), perceived price/value gaps.  
- **Channel behavior:** shoppers gravitate to **Amazon** and price-transparent retailers; D2C needs stronger value incentives.

A qualitative comparison of Bose, Sony, and Beats summaries appears in `/docs/Gemini_Speaker_Insights_Summary.txt`.
